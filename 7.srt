1
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,310
I'm going to sort things out in Bangkok for a few months.

2
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:15,520
Would you like to come with me?

3
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,330
Who painted them?

4
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,930
Kram…in this world….3 years ago.

5
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,320
So the Kram, in this world, used to date Tai?

6
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,350
Hmm.

7
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,850
And what happened 3 years ago?

8
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,960
How could you miss it

9
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,440
They were on their knees and I was careless.

10
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,410
I've told you! Sympathy weakens people down.

11
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,270
Don't miss it next time.

12
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,039
Yes, dad.

13
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,320
Keep an eye on Tai.

14
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,680
Can I make a call?

15
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,980
Just take a rest.

16
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,280
Kram.

17
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,400
Kram.

18
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,750
Kram.

19
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,280
Kram.

20
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,940
What happened? Kram!

21
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,680
Kram.

22
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,040
Kram.

23
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,120
Kram.

24
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,520
What's wrong with Kram?

25
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,010
His memories of this world are passing onto me.

26
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,170
And….and then what happened?

27
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,010
They all went to Kram's house,

28
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,740
killed his dad,

29
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,030
hurt his mother until she lost her sight

30
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,920
and threatened her not to tell.

31
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,640
Why did you have to kill Kram?

32
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,680
Because he weakened you down.

33
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,440
Kill me.

34
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,769
Take me down. So you can become the leader of Big Sulm.

35
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,660
Trade off my life with your growing up, do you think it's worth it?

36
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,280
In the end, Tai couldn't do it. He couldn't kill his own father.

37
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,040
After that,

38
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,040
Tai resigned from Big Slum gang

39
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,530
and lived a depressing life.

40
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,280
Until he met you.

41
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,070
Met me?

42
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,060
Yes.

43
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,110
Tai is back to life again after he met you.

44
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,330
Can I have this?

45
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,330
Once true love's created in the universe.

46
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:20,740
No matter how far the distance,  two hearts will find their way to one another

47
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Kram..Let's go

48
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,340
I'm sorry, Phupha

49
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,470
Tai.

50
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,720
What are you here?

51
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,120
I've decided not to go to Bangkok.

52
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,470
I'll stay here with you.

53
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,230
Sorry I was hesitant before.

54
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,090
But now I know how I feel.

55
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,060
I may not be the same Kram you're in love with in the other world.

56
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,920
But I'm this other Kram that loves you.

57
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,760
And although you're not the same Kram I fell in love with.

58
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,550
But I've already fallen for you too.

59
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:35,659
Do you know how grateful I am that we met.

60
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:42,419
How much I feel when we're close.

61
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,420
Want to treasure every moment,

62
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,040
every second.

63
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:55,670
You're always on my mind.

64
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:02,350
So they say happy times fly fast.

65
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:09,250
It might be too late before we know it.

66
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:22,300
I missed the chance to tell you how much I love you.

67
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,450
If I said I love you.

68
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:36,000
If destiny doesn't part our ways.

69
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:42,150
If you're still here with me.

70
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:52,520
I wonder if our hearts want the same thing.

71
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,960
Why am I shirtless?

72
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,850
Don't tell me we……..

73
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:05,570
Thank you but I'm too exhausted.

74
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,580
Wanna take a shower first?

75
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,200
Can I just go to bed?

76
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,800
You should take a shower.

77
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,740
Hmmm.

78
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,890
I can just take my shirt off and go to bed.

79
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,000
Can you go to bed with me?

80
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,120
Nooo.

81
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,050
Why not?? Let's just go to bed

82
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,690
No.

83
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:39,110
Come one.

84
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,700
Let's go to bed. Come on now.

85
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,740
OK OK.

86
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,440
You're such a whining baby, aren't you.

87
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,420
Was I really that bad?

88
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,480
Hmm.

89
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:21,070
Mum said I used to sleep talking a lot.

90
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,520
Never thought it's that bad.

91
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,010
The other Tai is exactly just like you

92
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:36,000
Hey….be nice. We're dating now.

93
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,000
You should be nicer to me.

94
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,520
What should I call you now?

95
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,370
Babe.

96
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,020
Just Kram should do.

97
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:58,840
But I want to feel like your little puppy.

98
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,720
Just Kram should be fine.

99
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,960
Nooo. Call me babe.

100
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,110
Kram.

101
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,000
Babe.

102
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,950
Kram!

103
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,670
Tai

104
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,820
What are you up to?

105
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,480
I'm making some soup.

106
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,220
Ouch!

107
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
You shouldn't be cooking if you know you're clumsy.

108
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,560
Thanks, bro.

109
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,360
Let me take care of it.

110
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,550
It's ok.

111
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,760
I want to do it…for you.

112
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,410
Here's how you hold a knife. Hold it right, alright?

113
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,890
Then you slide it down like this.

114
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,120
Got it?

115
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,440
Yup.

116
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,230
Eat while it's still hot

117
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,970
Wow. Tastes great.

118
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,970
Have you been in the kitchen much?

119
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,570
Kram I knew…

120
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,690
he likes this dish. So I've been learning how to cook it.

121
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:32,040
You just can't stop talking about him, can you?

122
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,390
I'm just a nobody.

123
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,720
Don't say that. You two are two different person.

124
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,720
Which Kram do you like more?

125
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,790
Both.

126
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,570
I knew you'd say that.

127
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,850
You're much cuter, babe.

128
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,960
What did you just call me?

129
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,460
I could only say it once.

130
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,030
And you missed it.

131
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,210
Say it again. I didn't hear it clearly. What did you just call me?

132
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,050
Say it one more time….please please.

133
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,240
I'll feed you if you do.

134
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,040
I said I could only say it once.

135
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,520
What now, Jao?

136
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,560
What happened?

137
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,700
Phupha….Phupha has been kidnapped!

138
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,450
I'm taking Janda to see her mum in Chiangmai for a week.

139
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,210
Do you want anything on my way back?

140
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,390
No worries, dad. Have fun.

141
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,960
Wayu, make a u-turn.

142
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,970
Where do you want to head to?

143
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:14,089
Do you think it's a good idea?

144
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,640
So it means…..

145
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,610
Janda's planning to kill me.

146
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,730
Get Chat and Aom to dig dirt on Janda. Check the tape…

147
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,960
Mr.Phupha!! Ouch

148
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,910
Wayu!!!

149
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,040
Stop!!!

150
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,070
They've escaped.

151
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,940
Let them go for now.

152
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,660
I've been digging dirt on who's been trying to take you down.

153
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:13,980
But I couldn't find anything. Never thought it would turn out to be Janda.

154
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,560
Well then dad must be…..

155
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,630
About your father and I …. I'll take care of it.

156
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,600
But we haven't got enough evidence.

157
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,830
Phupha's nearly killed in his home. That's enough proof already.

158
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,960
Then I'll just leave it with you.

159
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,690
Yes, auntie.

160
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,890
Your father and Janda have confessed.

161
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,850
What??

162
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:53,320
They've made a confession. All they've done is because they don't want you to become a successor.

163
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:14,080
Janda and dad just found out not long ago I'm not the real son.

164
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,750
That's why they've been threatening me not to take up the position?

165
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,500
Yes. But I guess it's because you didn't back down.

166
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,680
So now they want to have you killed.

167
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:36,300
And….you also knew?

168
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,470
I've been raising you like my own baby.

169
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,810
Though we're not related biologically,

170
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,510
but I do love you very much

171
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,330
Thank you so much.

172
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:32,360
If you're ever in need for help from now on, you don't have to say it out loud. This is what you have to do.

173
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,120
Tie your laces up into double knots.

174
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:43,480
I'll tell you teacher what it means

175
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,990
So they know you need their help.

176
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,660
I need to go to the restroom.

177
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,630
Find a way to escape. Aunty is the bad guy.

178
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,280
How are you planning to run away?

179
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,100
Don't worry. I'll find a way.

180
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,610
You….you've poisoned me?

181
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,960
How do you know?

182
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,720
Shoe..laces.

183
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:27,920
Oh…so that's he tied up my laces.

184
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,600
Can't help you much now that you know

185
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,080
Sorry, Phupha.

186
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:49,740
Everyone in Khumfah reports directly to Satreekij now

187
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:57,790
I don't know who I can ask for help. That's why I'm here. I need your help

188
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,710
Janda.

189
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:28,270
I used to hate you so much.

190
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:36,120
The wiser you are, the more it makes me look dumb.

191
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:44,170
But when I think about it now, you've never really said anything bad to me.

192
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:51,120
So I guess I don't hate you that much after all.

193
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,730
Mr.Phupha is up now, Maam.

194
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,280
I'll be there.

195
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,310
Phupha!

196
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,630
Phupha.

197
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:17,400
I've told you to take me instead!! What has my child got to do with this, huh?

198
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,550
You dragged Phupha into this mess.

199
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,950
If you hadn't tried to tie up my laces,

200
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,580
he would have not been here.

201
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,640
Why are you doing this? I thought we're family.

202
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,400
Family? You call this a family? Family full of hatred.

203
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,360
Bullshit!!

204
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,410
I've given your father so many chances.

205
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,650
But he's too stupid to realize it.

206
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,080
Arghh

207
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:01,170
What a stupid move making you a successor instead of me.

208
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,170
I'm his blood sister!!

209
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,790
It's time for me to get back what's mine.

210
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,560
Exactly when did you find out that I'm not your real son?

211
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:37,200
Your mother wrote a confession letter

212
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,950
when you were 7….

213
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,710
Before she took her life.

214
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,470
25 years ago

215
00:27:53,510 --> 00:28:02,070
It all began when mum was dating Wiroj, your real father.

216
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,420
Why?

217
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,040
Don't you love me?

218
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,270
Yes.

219
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,440
I'm not in love with you.

220
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,440
I'm in love with Adisak.

221
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,300
Adisak.

222
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,090
I've got something to tell you.

223
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,250
I've been thinking about it. I think…..

224
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,680
Who is it?

225
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:38,760
Sorry. I never meant to hide it but I haven't had a chance to tell Rojana.

226
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,030
We're about to have a child together.

227
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,190
Ummm…

228
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:03,240
Ummm. I'm really happy for you both.

229
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,480
Then your parents got married.

230
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:20,790
I never realized that baby was Wiroj's .

231
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:25,250
Dad…are you back? I've missed you.

232
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,430
I was shocked. I didn't know what to do.

233
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,190
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

234
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,220
I'm OK.

235
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,080
Now remember this.

236
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,820
No matter what happens,

237
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:14,800
I love you you	And I always will.

238
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,030
I'm so sorry.

239
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:37,480
I'm sorry I doubted you..

240
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:47,370
No problem. No problem at all, Phupha.

241
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,750
I love you very much.

242
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,750
I love you too,

243
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,750
Dad!!

244
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,750
Phupha, are you in there?

245
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:47,720
Yup.

246
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,610
You guys wait here. I'll take care of it.

247
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,010
Let me come with you.

248
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,390
I can't risk it.

249
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,280
But I'm the one who brought everyone to risk. If something happens to you….

250
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,670
I'll be OK.

251
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,850
Promise you'll come back to me?

252
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,640
I promise.

253
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,240
Jao!

254
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:14,700
Yes?

255
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,800
Take care of Kram for me.

256
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,760
Sure will.

257
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,060
Satreekij you bitch!

258
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,250
What have you done to Janda? You bitch!!!!

259
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,770
Aren't you guys hungry?  I've prepared your favorites.

260
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:22,840
I've got your favorite too, Janda. Try it! It's really nice.

261
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:32,920
Do you know why you're still alive?

262
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,920
You still love us?

263
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,080
You can't talk me into it with your sweet talk.

264
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,850
I won't let you go this time.

265
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:53,010
But now that I think of it. If you died, I'll become the first suspect.

266
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:06,650
So I think I might stab you first, then your dad

267
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:17,170
Then the police will think you two get into a fight…and kill one another.

268
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:23,960
Khumfah will be mine.

269
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,790
Don't you just feel like celebrating for me?

270
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,590
We haven't had drinks together in such a long time.

271
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,100
Let's make a toast.

272
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:29,620
How do you feel being taken down the same way too?

273
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,060
Mr.Phupha!

274
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,530
Chat! How did you get here?

275
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,140
I'm here to help you escape. Let's go.

276
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,290
Arghhh

277
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,500
Chat! You….

278
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,500
Can you remember me?

279
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,480
Dad! Run away!!

280
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,400
But you….

281
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,150
Go! Run! Get someone's help!!

282
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Since when have you been betraying behind my back?

283
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:23,160
Betray? I've been on Satreekij's side since the beginning.

284
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,840
Tai!

285
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,370
You again?

286
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,260
Good! Now I take a revenge for my brother.

287
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,480
Asshole!!

288
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,650
Boss!! Where's Mr.Phupha?

289
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,650
He's in a fight with Chat inside…

290
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:30,420
Chat…that guy has been betraying us.

291
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:32,930
What about Tai!!!

292
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:17,520
Argh!!!

293
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,200
Argh!!!

294
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,970
Kram! Where do you think you're going?

295
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,260
I'm going to save Tai.

296
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,600
It's too dangerous.

297
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,320
Tai's in danger!!

298
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,180
Kram.

299
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,010
I need to help Tai.

300
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,010
Kram…Kram!!

301
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,820
Just calm down.

302
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,990
Tai.

303
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,390
I thought you'd never come back.

304
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:21,360
I made my promise.

305
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,200
What are you staring at.

306
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,730
I'm just happy..that you're still here with me.

307
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:05,960
I'm afraid of losing my loved one.

308
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,920
I didn't think I'd make it that night either.

309
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,700
But I thought of the promise I gave you.

310
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,450
So I fought to the last minute.

311
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,740
And it made me realize…

312
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,850
What is it?

313
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,820
You're the one that makes me want to live my life a long long time.

314
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:00,920
I wouldn't ask for anything else but you.

315
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:13,280
Join the Ash Ceremony with me.

316
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,790
You don't have to decide now.

317
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,120
I know you've got a lot on your mind.

318
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,690
I can wait.

319
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:18,080
So they say happy times fly fast.

320
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:25,070
It might be too late before we know it.

321
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:37,900
I missed the chance to tell you how much I love you

322
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:44,510
If I said I love you.

323
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:51,900
If destiny doesn't part our ways

324
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:58,230
If you're still here with me.

325
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:08,120
I wonder if our hearts want the same thing

326
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:18,090
I don't want to be in a world without you

327
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:25,080
Only if I could turn back time. Only if I got to see you one more time

328
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:35,200
Don't want to be in a dream that would never come true

329
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:51,890
Only if I could turn back time. Only if I got to see you one more time

330
00:47:51,910 --> 00:48:02,320
Don't want to be in a dream that would never come true
