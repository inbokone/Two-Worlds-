1
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,100
Phupha! Watch out!!!

2
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,000
Arghhh

3
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,980
It’s you again?!?

4
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,580
Arghhh

5
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:31,580
Phupa….Phupha. Stay with me.

6
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,740
You have to stay with me.

7
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,610
Thank you for taking such a good care of me.

8
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:20,300
Rest in peace, dad.

9
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,470
Umm.. Are you sure you don’t want to report back to the president?

10
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,000
It must be someone in Khumfah who knows I’m not his real son.

11
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,480
We cannot trust anyone now….not even my dad.

12
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,800
The one who died in my world isn’t Wiroj.

13
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,820
It’s actually Phupha.

14
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,130
I don’t even know what to expect now.

15
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,120
We go with our plan….that is to protect Phupha.

16
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,840
Run…

17
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,680
can you stay in Bangkok for a while?

18
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,200
What about you?

19
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,820
I’ll stay. I’ll have to find out the whole truth.

20
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,020
Wayu…

21
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,800
Yes?

22
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,880
Please drop Run off to Bangkok.

23
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,180
Yes.

24
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,200
But we don’t have to car.

25
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,040
If we use car from Khumfah, I’m afraid they’ll find out.

26
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,640
Take my car then.

27
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,440
Jao, would you drop them off?

28
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,000
Me?

29
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,820
Or do you want me to?

30
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,740
I’ll do it.

31
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,470
Phupha.

32
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,820
Take care of yourself.

33
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,100
Take it easy, Phupha.

34
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,770
Take it easy.

35
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,770
You should stay at Jao’s for the night.

36
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,580
Is that a good idea?

37
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
Jao rarely stays there.

38
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,560
And his place is far away from people.

39
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,470
It’s a lot safer than my place.

40
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,110
Would it be safe for him to be on his own?

41
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,600
You stay there too.

42
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,940
Me?

43
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,570
You want to help Phupha out, don’t you?

44
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:37,010
Call me if you need anything. I’ll hurry back.

45
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,760
Thanks.

46
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,340
Um...

47
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,260
I don’t know why you’re saving me.

48
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,090
But I owe you guys big time.

49
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,680
Phupha!! You’re bleeding!!

50
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,540
Come sit here.

51
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,640
Take it easy.

52
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,640
Ouch!!

53
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,000
It doesn’t look good…the bleeding. Let me take a look.

54
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,990
Let’s take this off.

55
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,370
Tell me if it hurts.

56
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,550
What the hell!!

57
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,260
Oh well, you’re not very neat,

58
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,409
are you?

59
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,460
How do you know I’m not very neat?

60
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:05,660
Sit down. Let me take care of it.

61
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,620
Turn around. Let me take care of this first

62
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,450
Tai….Tai….

63
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,820
Tai….Tai….

64
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,310
Tai. Where do you think you’re going.

65
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,100
Tai…..hang on Tai!

66
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,740
What’s the fuss?

67
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,980
Are you leaving now? Why are you in such a hurry?

68
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,559
Not taking care of Phupha anymore?

69
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:43,809
I am…I did. I have.

70
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,390
I’ve gotta go now.

71
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,440
Hey!!

72
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,650
Are you mad  at me?

73
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,370
Why are you looking fussy?

74
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,160
I’m not fussy. Get out of my way.

75
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,010
Ouch….

76
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,940
Tai…Tai. Where are you going?

77
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,620
You don't answer me!

78
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,950
Why are you mad at me??

79
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,850
What the hell!! Why do I have to go with you.

80
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,240
As if I want you to.

81
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,780
Want me to stop the car?

82
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,660
What for?

83
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,540
So you can get out.

84
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,470
You get out.

85
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,220
You get out.

86
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,820
You should.

87
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,400
You get out.

88
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,000
You do.

89
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,500
You should.

90
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,200
You should.

91
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,840
You go.

92
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,280
Enough now!

93
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,840
Umm.. Should we stop and eat first?

94
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,660
Good idea. I have my favorite place ahead.

95
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,370
Oh yeah. Just like the old time. We used to ride there.

96
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,370
And uncle always scolded us.

97
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,120
You two again!!

98
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,540
You two look close to each other.

99
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,790
No way! I hate his gut!

100
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,650
He liked hanging around me because he had no friends.

101
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,540
This guy’s such a brat.

102
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,000
He used to follow me around all the time…

103
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,000
so annoying!!

104
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,230
You’re the whining one.

105
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,280
You’re the bragging one.

106
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,750
You’re the whining one.

107
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,710
You’re the bragging one.

108
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,520
You’re the whining one!

109
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,660
You’re the bragging one!

110
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,900
You’re the whining one!

111
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,280
You’re the bragging one!

112
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,580
Bingo! I got perfect 9

113
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,380
You cheater!

114
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,220
Watch your mouth!

115
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,500
I don’t care. Got a problem?

116
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,500
Sure you want trouble?

117
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,040
I was just…I was just kidding.

118
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,250
Let me go. I want to see my husband.

119
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,300
I need to see my husband. Why are you tying him up?

120
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,700
Let him go! Don’t speak. You’ll be ok.

121
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,090
Let me go! You’ll be ok.

122
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,880
Let me go! Let me go!!!

123
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:04,960
I’ve found out something about Tai, sir.

124
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,760
Jao!

125
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,660
Yes?

126
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,500
Big boss wants to talk to you.

127
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,030
What’s…what’s up boss?

128
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,670
Nothing much.

129
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,580
I want to know how my son’s doing.

130
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,380
Oh the usual. We hang out all the time.

131
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:07,840
Just that?

132
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,490
Yes.

133
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:20,110
Arghhh!!!

134
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,680
Who is he hiding away from me?

135
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,860
No one, boss.

136
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,140
Arghhh!!!

137
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,080
You have one more chance to answer my question.

138
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,220
Who is he hiding!!!

139
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,860
Hi, Wayu. You’ve dropped Run off already?

140
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,550
I want you to do a background check on Nopporn.

141
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,550
I can feel something fishy about him.

142
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,540
Tai…Tai…

143
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,340
Tai.

144
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,880
Tai.

145
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,440
Tai. Why are you here?

146
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,660
What’s up?

147
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,030
I just want to make sure….

148
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,270
I know why you’re frustrated

149
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,530
You can tell me if you no longer want to help me out.

150
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,370
I know what I’m asking for is a lot.

151
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,140
You can just say it. I don’t want to see you frustrated like this.

152
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
I’m sorry if I made you feel bad.

153
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,570
I just have a lot on my mind.

154
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,370
Nothing to do with you…really.

155
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,150
Really?

156
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,910
I gave you my words.

157
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Whatever happens, I’m here to help.

158
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,000
Thanks. I thought you’re mad at me.

159
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,190
I’m not mad.

160
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,060
I don’t hate you.

161
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,060
I can never hate you.

162
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,060
How are you, son?

163
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:11,720
What the fuck are you doing here?

164
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:22,780
It’s been 3 years. Can’t we be nice?

165
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,770
I remember the last time we met. I had a knife on your throat.

166
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,820
Umm…

167
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,720
I have a job for you.

168
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:45,120
I know the cops are coming after me and my casino.

169
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:50,030
I want you to kidnap his son….just to threaten him.

170
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,780
And why should I have to do it?

171
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,530
Here’s why?

172
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,170
Are you threatening me?

173
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,450
I don’t joke. I never joke.

174
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,160
If you don’t do it, I can burn them down.

175
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,160
What the fuck are you doing??

176
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,980
You know what weakens people down?

177
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,460
Feelings!!

178
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:37,580
You’ll get over it as long as you have a heart.

179
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:44,880
Think about it. Are you gonna do it, son?

180
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,040
Any news?

181
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,120
Nopporn is a fake name.

182
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,660
Tai sometimes calls him Kram.

183
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,860
It’s really strange. There’s only one Kram in Rattha.

184
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,700
And that Kram died 3 years ago…

185
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,960
because of Por.

186
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Maybe Krams’ still alive?

187
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,590
Maybe he’s back for revenge?

188
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,050
He’s trying to get close to us…

189
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,100
because he wants us to take Por.

190
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,910
This is getting too carried away.

191
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,330
Hey!!

192
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,780
Big boss wants to talk to you.

193
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,420
Ouch!!!

194
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,600
Run Phupha…run!!!

195
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,210
Just go! Run!!! Go!!

196
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,260
I don’t think he can catch up with us now.

197
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,270
How did they find out about us?

198
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,350
You should know it best, Kram?

199
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,670
You tricked us into all this?

200
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,540
In fact you’re Kram.

201
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,310
the Kram who should have been dead 3 years ago.

202
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,800
But you’re still alive.

203
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,410
And you want us to take a revenge for you,right?

204
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,990
You’re all wrong!!! It’s not what you think it is.

205
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,550
So what’s the truth?

206
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,670
You listen to me.

207
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,290
I have my reason why I can’t tell you who I really am.

208
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,940
But I know nothing about Por.

209
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:20,040
I promise I’ll tell you everything when it’s all over.

210
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,040
Phupha!

211
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,080
Are you alright?

212
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,860
I’m alright…I’m ok.

213
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,180
Thanks.

214
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,670
Get into the car, Phupha! Come on now. Quick!!

215
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,640
Gasohol?

216
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,480
Gasohol91 please.

217
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,120
Sure.

218
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,780
What’s wrong?

219
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,320
I need to pee.

220
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,900
Then go pee!

221
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,050
I’m afraid you’ll leave me here.

222
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,050
I told you I trust you. How can I leave you behind?

223
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,060
Promise?

224
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:49,930
Promise.

225
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,160
I’ll be right back.

226
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,620
Why is it taking so long?

227
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,100
We’ve got a bit of a problem. It’s stuck.

228
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:06,960
What??

229
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:11,600
It’s stuck. I can’t take this thing out.

230
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,520
Hey!!

231
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,280
Let go!!

232
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,680
Hey!!!

233
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,010
Ouch…..

234
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,380
Tai. Wait up! Ouchhh

235
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,680
Are you ok?

236
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:32,070
My foot! I think I’ve sprained my foot.

237
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,310
You can hardly walk yourself….let alone you can save Phupha.

238
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,720
Come here now.

239
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,900
I have you. I think I’m ok.

240
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,200
What if I’m not around? What are you gonna do?

241
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,370
I know you’ll save me.

242
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,140
You silly kiddo.

243
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,000
Oiii

244
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,530
What do you think you’re doing?

245
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,000
Nothing.

246
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,720
What do you think you’re doing?

247
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,380
Why are you teaming up with Tai. What are you going to do?

248
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,090
Someone from Khumfah tried to kill me.

249
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:41,220
I cannot trust anyone now. So I hired Tai to protect me.

250
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:49,280
We have evidence, sir.

251
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,920
So it’s a misunderstanding?

252
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,880
Oh I’m sorry.  Old man’s fault.

253
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,100
I’m sorry.

254
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,470
So you’ll let us go?

255
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,660
Sure!

256
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,420
If you survive my game.

257
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,640
I’ll let each and every one of you shoot yourselves in the head

258
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,820
Whoever survives, I’ll let you go

259
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,820
You first, Phupha!

260
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,900
Take this

261
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,000
Hahaha. It’s not your time yet eh?

262
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,090
Now you!

263
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,460
Do it!

264
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:47,520
Don’t fool me you asshole!

265
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,820
What the fuck!!

266
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,360
Your turn now!

267
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,000
Why do you look familiar.

268
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,820
Arrr…..you’re the one who looks like Kram.

269
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,310
That’s why Tai….

270
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,850
That's because you're. Quick!!!

271
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:52,960
We’re good now, Phupha! We’re saved!!

272
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,690
Piak…

273
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,120
Yes, boss.

274
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:03,520
have I told them only two will survive??

275
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,720
You have to pick the lucky two now.

276
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,800
Phupha, you get to choose!

277
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,380
I’m really sorry.

278
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,620
Nop. Nop….it’s me.

279
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,920
Aunty…

280
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,440
Give him some water.

281
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:33,870
Drink up, kiddo.

282
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:50,250
How are you, Nop? Why are you here?

283
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:58,480
It’s a long story. But I’m alright.

284
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:07,480
Poor you. You shouldn’t have….

285
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,120
Someone’s coming! You have to go now, aunty!

286
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,500
You go now, aunty!

287
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,490
I’m such a coward. Kram tried to save me many times.

288
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,490
You were forced by Por.

289
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,600
It’s not your fault.

290
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:48,330
Don’t blame yourself.

291
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:52,080
Por’s a bastard!!

292
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,230
What would you do if you were me?

293
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,640
I would have pretended nothing happened….

294
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,080
Because I’m the president of Khumfah.

295
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:32,910
Nop…Nop. I’m here now. I’m here to save you

296
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,640
Aunty! What are you doing here?!?

297
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:40,290
I’m here to save you. Is it ok now? Is it torn?

298
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,290
Hey!! What the fuck are you doing?

299
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,530
Aunty!! You should go…now!!

300
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,760
Aunty!

301
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,240
Ouch!

302
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,590
Not your business, bitch!

303
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:59,090
Enough now! Please. I beg you.

304
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:03,100
I asked her to come help me. She’s blind.

305
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:07,500
Please let her go. I beg you. Please!!

306
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,450
I beg you. Please!!

307
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,520
Get out of here! Now!

308
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,140
Let’s go now

309
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,840
Get out! Don’t ever let me see you again!

310
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,850
You have to come back no matter what. Promise me.

311
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,740
Hmm… I promise.

312
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:03,080
Phupha. Help!

313
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:10,080
Phupha! You have to stay with me. I beg you. Please. I beg you

314
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,450
That's the Phupha you’re talking about?

315
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:24,960
But the Phupha I know…he’s dead.

316
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:33,510
I told you, I’ve done it to save Phupha’s life.

317
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,280
Save Phupha?

318
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:42,820
Phupha. Don’t go. You’re gonna be just fine.

319
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,100
You have to be fine. Phupha.

320
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,000
Now you have to choose who will go out alive.

321
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,530
I’m really sorry.

322
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,060
Tai.

323
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:30,760
I told you I’d look after you no matter what.

324
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,560
This way! Quick!!

325
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,620
What would you do..if you were me?

326
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,400
I would have pretended nothing happened….

327
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,760
Because I’m the president of Khumfah.

328
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:19,050
Everyone would say that.

329
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:21,050
But I know you well.

330
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,460
Let’s go rescue Kram.

331
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,300
Stop! Let them go.

332
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,070
You both guard the back. Go!

333
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:06,320
Let’s split up here. I’ve gotta take care of something.

334
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,680
Wayu.

335
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,200
You should be safe here. It’s far from everyone

336
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,350
Stay here for the time being.

337
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,520
Kram?

338
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,990
Where have you been?

339
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,290
I…umm…

340
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,840
You promised you’d take care of me.

341
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:05,030
Phupha left me.

342
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,260
And you disappeared.

343
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:12,080
You promised you’d stay to take care of me.

344
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:19,230
Yeah right. Am I that worthless? Everyone’s leaving me

345
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,940
Everyone’s leaving me.

346
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:47,290
I’m really sorry…
