1
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,780
I killed the boss. I don’t think I can run away now.

2
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,820
You act like you’ve already taken care of the one who killed big boss.

3
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,940
I can’t do it.

4
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,310
You disappoint me to the last minute.

5
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,810
Big slum gang is now yours, son.

6
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,729
What are you doing?

7
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,250
Whenever I have a bad dream, dad would do this to ease it away.

8
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,030
Thank you.

9
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,170
Hmmm.

10
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,329
How could you kiss him like that, Kram?

11
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,880
You like Phupha.

12
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,660
You’re into Phupha!! Yeah..

13
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:11,450
Kram, breakfast is ready. Come eat now.

14
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,160
You go ahead. I have to run some errands.

15
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,150
What errands?

16
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:28,120
Meeting my mom. I’m going to mom’s house.

17
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,320
I’ll see you later.

18
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:49,290
Your food is always the best, mom.

19
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,740
Oh I meant auntie.

20
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:58,350
You can just call her mom if you keep making mistakes.

21
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,400
Can I do that, mom?

22
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,280
Suit yourself then.

23
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,150
Why isn’t Tai with you today?

24
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,040
He’s pretty busy these days.

25
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,250
I don’t want to bother him.

26
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,960
Then you should stop by more often. Mom can cook.

27
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,210
Just tell her what you’d like to eat.

28
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,590
Are you sure?

29
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,780
Sure! Why not? You can stay over if you want.

30
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,430
I know you want him to stay over, don’t you?

31
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,920
You can’t even stop smiling.

32
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,240
What do you say? Staying overnight?

33
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,100
Sure. I want to stay with you too.

34
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,340
Thanks so much for today.

35
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,440
No worries at all. Feel free to call whenever you need us.

36
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,780
We know exactly which side to pick.

37
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,140
Why pick side?

38
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,130
Well, now that you’re in charge.

39
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,940
I’m still the same person I used to ber.

40
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,700
Whatever you say. We should get going now. See you later.

41
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,120
See you soon.

42
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,340
And you?

43
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,380
I need to use the bathroom.

44
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,880
Thank you.

45
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,500
I’m gonna be at mom’s for a while, not to worry. Kram.

46
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Tai, is everything ok?

47
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,250
No.

48
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,200
Tai, is everything ok?

49
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,300
Is this making you stressed?

50
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,170
What have you done to him?

51
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,110
Not your business.

52
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,720
What’s up, Phupha?

53
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,740
Why did you ask me to come over?

54
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,180
I’ve got something to show you.

55
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,920
Are you going to…….

56
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,440
We’re extending a new clothing line.

57
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,440
So we want to pay you back.

58
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,650
You’ll be our very first customers to try on our clothes…for free!!

59
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,540
It’s alright.

60
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,280
Phupha wants to host a thank you party for everyone.

61
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,070
So he wants us to dress well.

62
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,260
Now that you guys are here.

63
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,150
Go on. Try one some clothes.

64
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:20,040
I want to see you dressed up.

65
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,970
If you’d excuse me for a bit.

66
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,640
Hmmm.

67
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,460
Ahem…

68
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,880
How do I look? Not ok?

69
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,010
I think it really suits you.  You look really good.

70
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,910
And we match.

71
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,020
Take a look!

72
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,890
This party is to thank everyone for having been such great help.

73
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,400
Free flow tonight. Cheers!!

74
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,640
Cheers!!

75
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,400
Yeah !!

76
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,110
What’s wrong?

77
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,180
Drink too much?

78
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Fuck off.

79
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,200
I don’t want to bother you…

80
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,000
but that’s my glass!!

81
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,750
Huh.

82
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,050
I’ll grab some food over there.

83
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,320
What’s wrong now? Another heartbreak?

84
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,560
Not your fucking business.

85
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,270
Don’t tell me it’s your boss.

86
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,220
How did you find out?

87
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,220
Anyone could tell!!

88
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,890
The way you look at him.

89
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,450
It’s different from the way you look at everyone else.

90
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,280
I just realized that I like Kram.

91
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,170
Not a surprise. You’re glued to him.

92
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,570
Damn it!!

93
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,840
Kram should just end up with Phupha.

94
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,840
Phupha is engaged. Let me give you a piece of advice.

95
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,940
There’s only one way out.

96
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,280
What advice?

97
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:28,240
You just have to find someone new, So you can forget about the old one.

98
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,340
What the hell?

99
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
Would have been nice if it was that easy.

100
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,480
Still hungry?

101
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,520
I’ll be back. Excuse me.

102
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,330
What’s wrong?

103
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,710
Why are you out here by yourself?

104
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,680
You can talk to me if you want.

105
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,240
How did you guess?

106
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,940
I’d like to mind people’s business.

107
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:46,630
Then let me ask you something. This is about my friend.

108
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,240
Hmm.

109
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:53,000
What if I…. I meant my friend.

110
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,180
Arrr

111
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:00,880
Fell for someone but he’s already in love with someone else.

112
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,840
What do you think my friend should do?

113
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,460
Is this what’s been bothering you?

114
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,530
Hmm. I’ve been thinking about it for a few day now.

115
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,940
Well, if it was me..Hmmm I think

116
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,700
I’d pick the first one.

117
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,270
Why?

118
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,700
Because people get distracted easily with new things.

119
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,620
It could be temporary.

120
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,430
You think about it.

121
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,410
Prem.

122
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,350
I’m Buai.

123
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,490
I’m Prem.

124
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,710
Arr. Are we there yet?

125
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,770
And what the hell is wrong with you guys?

126
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,910
I’m B1.

127
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,220
And I’m B2.

128
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,440
Then I’m B3.

129
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,520
I think you’re drunk.

130
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,200
I said I’m not drunk.

131
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,050
You almost kicked that waiter’s butt. You should go to bed.

132
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,090
Make sure he’s ok.

133
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:34,460
Tai…hey…Are you sure you can get home?

134
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:55,560
If you’re not feeling ok, you can sleep at Jao’s.

135
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,560
I’m ok.

136
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,400
Hang on. Don’t go yet.

137
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,280
Let me drop you home.

138
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,460
Kram.. I have something to tell you.

139
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,120
You will have to take care of yourself from now on.

140
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,480
I’ll take care of Phupha myself.

141
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,580
Talk to aunty Liu if you need anything.

142
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,610
Why does it sound like you’re leaving me?

143
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,270
You’re the one leaving me.

144
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,450
It’s not what you think it is.

145
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,120
I think I’m alright now. I can go home by myself.

146
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,720
Good luck to you.

147
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,180
Tai, I’ve bought you some food. Wanna eat now?

148
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,040
Your place is a mess. I’ll help clean up.

149
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,990
Where’s the broom?

150
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,470
Is it in this room?

151
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,750
Leave that room alone.

152
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,880
But it’s such a big mess. Let me help you clean up the place.

153
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,110
Let me in….please?

154
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,730
I said leave that fucking room alone!!!

155
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,410
Sorry. You should go now.

156
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,420
Ok.

157
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,150
You wanted to see me?

158
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,730
Take a seat.

159
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,330
I’m going to sort things out in Bangkok

160
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,920
for a few months.

161
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,850
It should be safer there than in Rattha.

162
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,850
I don’t think they’ll do anything while I’m gone.

163
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,000
Well, then…..have a safe trip.

164
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,690
Don’t you want to come too?

165
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,300
I’d feel safer with you around.

166
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,800
Would you like to come with me?

167
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,990
Tai. Are you there?

168
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,080
Tai.

169
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,280
Tai.

170
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,860
Tai.

171
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,200
This is why he wouldn’t let me in here.

172
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,790
He still keeps these pictures.

173
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,250
Who painted them?

174
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,650
Kram…in this world….3 years ago.

175
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,770
So the Kram, in this world, used to date Tai?

176
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,890
Hmm.

177
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,550
And what happened 3 years ago?

178
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,870
Why do you want to know?

179
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,790
I’m also him. I have the right to know.

180
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,610
Oops..Ouch!! Watch out kiddo!

181
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,450
Did anyone hurt you?

182
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,270
Tell me so I can help you out.

183
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:57,130
Hey! Hey!!!

184
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,710
Thanks bro.

185
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,700
And that’s the first time they met in this world.

186
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,820
Kram. What’s wrong?

187
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,520
Kram!!!

188
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,880
What’s wrong? You’re having a headache?

189
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,580
N….No.

190
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,600
You shouldn’t be around here. It’s too dangerous.

191
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,060
ok.

192
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,400
Are you that afraid of me?

193
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,660
You’re Tai, son of Por.

194
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,120
I might be his son. But I’m not cruel like him. I’ve never killed anyone.

195
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,740
You don’t have to be afraid of me.

196
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,550
So…..what are you doing around here?

197
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,580
It’s a secret.

198
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,600
You watch yourself. You might not be so lucky next time.

199
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,980
You! It’s about to rain. Hey..hey.

200
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,100
What are you doing?

201
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,060
I saw you lying here so I just wanted to paint your portrait.

202
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,280
And it’s about to rain….so I just wanted to tell you.

203
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,120
This looks nice.

204
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,690
Are you an artist?

205
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,450
No. I just love to paint.

206
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,380
Sometimes I try to sell them at the market in town.

207
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,650
But I’m not really good at it, I guess.

208
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,750
Then I’d like to buy this one.

209
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,850
It’s just a sketch. Wasn’t planning to sell it

210
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,530
But I want it.

211
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:13,360
I can just give it to you…with only one condition.

212
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:14,520
What is it?

213
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,890
Would you be my friend?

214
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:19,730
What?

215
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,860
I stay up here all by myself. There’s no one around.

216
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,730
I get lonely most of the time. Would you be my friend? Please?

217
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,950
Why are you laughing? What’s so funny?

218
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,410
Who would want to be your friend!

219
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,080
I’m leaving now if you’re not selling.

220
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,080
Why you herry?

221
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,690
Wait for me.

222
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,690
Bro…bro.

223
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,240
Hey!!

224
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,670
Thank you.

225
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:20,930
Let’s find a shed.

226
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,560
Bro!

227
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,030
Wait up! Wait for me

228
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,410
Aren’t you gonna take off your clothes to dry?  You could be sick.

229
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,440
I normally just do this.

230
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,270
What?

231
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:12,290
You’ve got something on your face.  But it’s gone now.

232
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,070
Thank you for saving me so many times.

233
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,510
I think we might have to stay here tonight.

234
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,700
I’m cold.

235
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,880
I’m cold.

236
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:00,880
I’m cold.

237
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,070
It’s so cold.

238
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,650
Oh. You’re up.

239
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,420
How did I get here?

240
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,650
Tai brought you here.

241
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,250
He carried you all the way down from the cave.

242
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,880
You can go home after you get some rest, I’ll have to see other patient now.

243
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,950
Thanks, doctor.

244
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,840
Wow. It’s beautiful.

245
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,390
What made you bring me here.

246
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,120
It’s my last day here.

247
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,130
You mean….

248
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:57,280
My work is done. I have to go back to Big Slum.

249
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,790
So you mean you’ll not be here anymore?

250
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,200
That means I won’t have any friends now.

251
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,010
I’ve told you I’m not your friend.

252
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,920
But I want to be more.

253
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,150
Bura.

254
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,130
This smells so nice.

255
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,680
Though it was only so short.

256
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,770
But I’ve been very happy having you around.

257
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,200
I want to stay longer with you too.

258
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,070
Kram…

259
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,580
Come with me.

260
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,580
I’ll ask for your parents’ permission.

261
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,820
Hmmm.

262
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:21,250
If I said I love you

263
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:28,080
If destiny doesn’t part our ways

264
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:34,590
If you’re still here with me

265
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:44,120
I wonder if our hearts want the same thing

266
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:49,460
Wow! Your house is beautiful!!

267
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,290
We’ve just finished decorating it.

268
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,659
So much to play around with.

269
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,070
Oooh this seat is so soft.

270
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,300
And the view out there is so nice.

271
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,190
And this plant….

272
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:16,960
Like it?

273
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,890
Love it.

274
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,980
What are you making? Smells good.

275
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,930
Done just now.

276
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,440
Wow!!

277
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,130
Hungry yet?

278
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,680
I am. Let’s eat. Come..

279
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:11,770
Good?

280
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,130
Why are you lighting up?

281
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,130
These past few months…made me realize that you’re the one.

282
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:48,040
You’re the one that makes me want to live for as long as I can.

283
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:55,330
Kram…join me in an Ash Exchange ceremony.

284
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,730
No matter what happens,

285
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:15,520
I’ll be with you for the rest of my life.

286
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,420
I love you, Kram.

287
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:18,250
So they say happy times fly fast.

288
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:25,260
It might be too late before we know it

289
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:31,780
I missed the chance to tell you how much I love you

290
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:38,150
At least ask for a chance to say goodbye.

291
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:44,960
If I said I love you.

292
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:51,640
If destiny doesn’t part our ways

293
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:58,240
If you’re still here with me.

294
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:08,120
I wonder if our hearts want the same thing

295
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:17,950
I don’t want to be in a world without you

296
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:25,080
Only if I could turn back time. Only if I got to see you one more time

297
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:33,840
Don’t want to be in a dream that would never come true

298
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:51,780
Only if I could turn back time. Only if I got to see you one more time

299
00:47:51,800 --> 00:48:02,150
Don’t want to be in a dream that would never come true
