1
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,800
You go home and wait for me there.

2
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,630
If I don’t come back by tomorrow morning,call the police.

3
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,460
Don’t you say that. I know you’ll be back.

4
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,410
Promise me you will.

5
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,600
I promise.

6
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:00,950
Phupha!!

7
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,140
Phupa Phupha!! I’m back.

8
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:16,660
Phupha!! Help!! Anyone here?

9
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:30,100
Phupa Phupha!! Answer me!! Help! Stay with me.

10
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,820
I beg you. I beg you. You have to stay with me

11
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,540
I’m right here.

12
00:02:49,250 --> 00:03:01,670
You’re still alive!!! Phupha…Phupha. Don’t ever leave me.

13
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,050
Promise me, will you?

14
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,170
I promise.

15
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,010
Hey!!

16
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,960
Are you alright.

17
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,690
Phupha.

18
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,510
Phupha…

19
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,840
I’m back as promised.

20
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,610
Phupha!!

21
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,020
What Phupha? What’s up?

22
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,800
You have to stay with me

23
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,870
I’m right here.

24
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,100
Phupha…Phupha. Don’t ever

25
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,390
Promise me, will you?

26
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,100
Promise me, will you?

27
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,340
Phupha…Phupha. Don’t ever leave me

28
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,620
Kram

29
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,120
Phupha…

30
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,080
I’m back as promised

31
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:27,910
Phupha…

32
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:33,560
What Phupha?

33
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,170
What’s up?

34
00:06:56,659 --> 00:07:00,520
Nothing… You just happen to look like someone I know.]

35
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,420
Get changed!

36
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,120
Why do you have this….{

37
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,520
Or you want me to change for you?

38
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,159
Wait… Dry up with this

39
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,480
Thank you

40
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,010
Thank you. I won’t bother you now

41
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,410
Wait! What’s your name?

42
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,270
I’m Kram

43
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,809
Are you kidding me?

44
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,659
I’m Kram. That’s my name…Kram

45
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:51,060
Same name, same face. Come here!

46
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,000
Wait!

47
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,070
I’ll take you to someone.

48
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,460
Where are you taking me to?

49
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,160
Just come with me

50
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,160
What if I don’t want to

51
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,210
What do you think you’re doing. Let me go!!

52
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,970
You played it hard at first.

53
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:21,160
Why did you tie me up? Let me go. Let go!!

54
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:21,900
Shut up!

55
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,060
What’re you doing? Hey!!

56
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,150
Are you that scared of me?

57
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,370
You look like someone threatening that I know

58
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,630
Who?

59
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,370
Tai, son of Por.

60
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,880
That’s me. Tai, son of Por.

61
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:04,210
But Tai that I know has a scar on his face. But you….

62
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,670
I don’t know what shit you’re talking about

63
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,330
But I’m definitely not who you think I am.

64
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,370
I’ve brought you here because there are unresolved issues.

65
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,080
But I know there’s one person who could give us clue.

66
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:48,810
Identical! You look exactly just like him.

67
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,700
Like who? I’m confused now.

68
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,920
Like Kram we used to know.

69
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,110
But I’ve never seen any of you before.

70
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,200
We’re not talking about you. Kram we know died 3 years ago.

71
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:20,230
Your name, your look, the way you talk

72
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,660
So it make me think for the moonlight pond  tale.

73
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,370
Have you been to the Moon Shadow Waterfall?

74
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:41,360
Yes. The water happened to be blue that day. I fell into itใ

75
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:48,920
And when I woke up, I found this Tai – who looks like another Tai I know.

76
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,940
But he’s a different Tai, you know what I mean?.

77
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:59,420
I understand how confused you must be. But listen to me carefully…

78
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,400
You have just crossed the boundary from your world to this world.

79
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,980
through the power of Moon Shadow Waterfall

80
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,200
Crossed the boundary?

81
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:25,180
Yes. I myself met someone I shouldn’t have at the fall.

82
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,110
You’ve never told me this.

83
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,180
Who would have believed me at the time.

84
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,330
I realized the meaning of the myth.

85
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:48,390
Moon Shadow Waterfall reunites you with deceased one.

86
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:55,430
It doesn’t mean resurrection but it’s the coming of people from the other world.

87
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:03,380
I guess it’s self explanatory why you look exactly like Kram we used to know.

88
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:10,610
Only differences in both are time and incidents.

89
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,710
I think it’s getting little carried away now. I don’t believe it!

90
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:39,940
Hey!! Hey!! What happened here!!

91
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,670
“Kram”

92
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,490
Wow. So this is Phupa’s office.

93
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,200
It’s not just mine. One day it will be ours.

94
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,120
Maybe that’s a bad idea. I’ve never worked before

95
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:24,480
It’s OK. Having you here is already overwhelming for me

96
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,260
A bit much, you think?

97
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,300
Oh, you’re back

98
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:06,300
I’m sorry sir. I was called by the president to pick up some documents.

99
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,860
Your dad must have been so tough on you. Maybe you deserve a raise, huh?

100
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,350
That’s the Phupa you’re talking about?

101
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,930
Phupha I know is dead..

102
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,030
Do you know what Phupha is like in this world?

103
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:04,990
I don’t.

104
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,319
But you’re working for the enemy of Khumfah right? You should know better.

105
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,230
What’s Phupha like in this world?

106
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,349
I’ve quitted a long time ago. I don’t have anything to do with them anymore

107
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,730
I’ve never even met Phupha.

108
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,150
So you know what happened to my family.

109
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,060
I do. But I don’t know if it’s what you want to hear.

110
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,900
Just tell me the truth.

111
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:01,300
After you died, your father died not long after.

112
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,570
That house was left empty.

113
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:18,100
So I basically have nothing in this world - no house, no friends.

114
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,320
Gosh now I know how it feels to be invisible.

115
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,820
It’s not that bad.

116
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,370
It is that bad. I feel so lost.

117
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,060
It’s me you have, at least.

118
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:56,480
I know who you are. I know how you feel.

119
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,230
If you have no place to go, you can come stay with me first.

120
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,120
Would that be a good idea?

121
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,820
Until you find a way to get back to your world,

122
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,150
I’ll do the best I can to help.

123
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,830
Thanks. I feel a whole lot better now.

124
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,850
Water substance usually appears on a full moon night.

125
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,130
Looking at the calendar, the next one will come in 3 months.

126
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,940
That’s when you can go.

127
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,380
3 months… That’s what I had in mind.

128
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,840
What do you have in mind?

129
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,930
I got to thinking last night what  I should be doing in this world.

130
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:01,280
Some things happen in advance and some things are behind to where I was living.

131
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,350
For example, Phupha hasn’t got promoted.

132
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:15,410
and not assassinated.

133
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,450
And?

134
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:22,530
So I still have time to save hime.

135
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,360
It might sound simple as a plan.

136
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,010
But Phupha isn’t someone you can easily get to.

137
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,600
That’s why I need Thai’s help.

138
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:39,600
My help?

139
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,780
You said you’d do the best you can.

140
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,720
Please, I beg you, I need your help.

141
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,460
What I meant was to help you get back to your world.

142
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,210
not anything to do with Phupha.

143
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,090
I’m sorry. But it’s none of my business. I’ve gotta get going now.

144
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,580
Pleaseeee. I’d do anything you want.

145
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,330
But please help me save Phupha.

146
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,240
Why do you want to help Phupha so much.

147
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:31,370
Phupha and I…..we’re close friends.

148
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,750
I don’t think I can.

149
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:42,610
Well then why did you ask?!?

150
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:53,420
“3 months later
Khumfah”

151
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,210
Come in.

152
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,680
Bad dreams again?

153
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,320
Hmm. So what’s up?

154
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,700
The president wants to see you at the office.

155
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,710
Oh you’re here. Need your help deciding where I should go.

156
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,060
Phuket, Krabi, or Phanggha.

157
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:15,190
Phuket sounds nice. My friend owns a resort there. It’s beautiful.

158
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,930
How long are you going for?

159
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,600
A year maybe.

160
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,050
You’re not saying…..

161
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:35,220
Yes. I asked Janda to marry me. I’m thinking of retiring somewhere.

162
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,800
And you’re sure she’s the one?

163
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:49,110
You should stop being bias. I know she’s a lot younger than me.

164
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:57,660
But she’s working really hard. She gets me. I know I picked the right one.

165
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,880
If you are so certain. Then I respect your decision.

166
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,540
Thank you son. After the wedding,

167
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,220
I’ll announce your succession

168
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:21,940
Be prepared for a whold new life full of complications.

169
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,660
I won’t let you down.

170
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,660
Good!

171
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,440
You have to sign these.

172
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,010
OK. Put them over there

173
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,470
No breakfast again?

174
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,560
I’ll eat when I’m hungry.

175
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,350
You’re still weak and you have to take pills after breakfast.

176
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:08,520
}If Por ever finds out our CEO is weak, they could easily attack us.

177
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:15,300
Got it. I’ll take them later. How’s the bodyguard scouting going?

178
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:19,630
I’ve shortlisted to 3 - impressive profile.

179
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,150
I’ll set up a meeting for you to meet them.

180
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,560
Yes. Bring them in.

181
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:42,920
This is Ohm. This is Chad. And this is…

182
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,240
I’m Bill.

183
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,850
”3 months ago
Tai’s house”

184
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,240
Hey!!

185
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,350
Don’t be alarmed.

186
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,220
I left the pan hot for too long so I burned an egg.

187
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,650
What you’re doing???

188
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:36,900
I’m here to beg. Please help me with Phupha.

189
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,050
I promise to make breakfast everyday

190
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:50,580
Please…please please

191
00:26:51,120 --> 00:27:01,720
Tai..Tai Tai please I beg you. Please help me out.

192
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,470
I don’t give up easily

193
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:28,160
and you’ll find out.

194
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:42,030
Tai. I beg of you. Please. If you help me out,

195
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:48,410
I promise i’ll do anything You’re fishing right? Here.

196
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:58,870
Why don't you tie this to the rod. Let me do it for you.

197
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:20,590
Bring it up. Here we go.

198
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:47,690
Tai. It's so cold. I'm so so cold.

199
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:16,060
Please don't go. Tai. Tai. Come back.

200
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,680
What's wrong with him? Why does he have such a cold heart?

201
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,510
And where am I now. How do I get home?!

202
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:30,530
A rabbit!! You must be in pain. I'll set you free. Here. Go.

203
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:40,320
What have you done to my trap? That was my rabbit!

204
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,190
I don't get it. You can eat so many other meat.

205
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,160
Why rabbit!! It's too cute to be eaten

206
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,160
You're talking way too much, you know?

207
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,800
What are you doing to my people?

208
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,380
Thank you for saving me… Ouch!

209
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,380
So this is your plan to get my attention?

210
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,600
What plan?

211
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,080
You got yourself into trouble because you wanted me to come save you.

212
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,720
No!! I just wanted to help the rabbit..

213
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,690
You want me to help you with Phupha.

214
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,990
That's why you had to do something stupid like this

215
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,170
If this is all you can think of, there's no way you can save Phupha.

216
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:25,520
I know I'm a loser, I'm a coward. I'll never be good enough. Happy now?

217
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,250
I just wanted to say….

218
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:34,930
You were right… IlI'll never be good enough to be able to save Phupha.

219
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:56,240
From my mother, to Phupha, I've never been able to save anyone.

220
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:06,600
All I could do was just to stand there witnessing their deaths.

221
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,360
But let me tell you this.

222
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,450
I'll never use death as a cry for help.

223
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,470
I know how it feels to lose someone you love.

224
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:41,890
I'm truly sorry. And I won't bother you from now on

225
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:52,980
Wait!  I'm sorry… But let me ask you one more time

226
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,160
Why do you want to help Phupha out so much?

227
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,630
Is he really that significant to you in that world?

228
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:14,130
Phupha and I… We’re really close friends.

229
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:24,719
Close friends that take extra care of one another

230
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,290
Before we know it, we already had feelings for each other

231
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,280
Why didn't you say it in the beginning?

232
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,389
It's not an ordinary relationship like everyone else's

233
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,360
So I was afraid people wouldn't understand

234
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:49,650
I get it. Love is more about heart than head

235
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,460
Tai..

236
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,580
I kinda had a guess about you and Phupha at first.

237
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,340
]But why didn't you..

238
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:10,670
I hate liars. Now that you're telling me the truth…

239
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,090
I guess I can help you with Phupha.

240
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,770
Seriously?

241
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,520
Yes. You can have my word

242
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:27,860
Thanks bro. I was lucky to have met you

243
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:08,500
OK. So now I'm with Boom, Namwan, and Nopporn.. Right?

244
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,840
Let's start with the first question

245
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,800
Why do you want to work with Khumfah?

246
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:21,250
High and fair pay

247
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:26,110
I was an intern here and very impressed with family system

248
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,110
Everyone is so nice and dedicated

249
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,300
What about you, Nopporn?

250
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,150
… I want to work here because of you, Mr. Phupha

251
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,690
What's your plan for growing Khumfah to be sustainable and

252
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,740
long standing. Let's start with you, Nopporn

253
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,360
I will…take the best care of you, Mr. Phupha.

254
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:04,370
because I know you'll take Khumfah to the next level for sure.

255
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,370
Nopporn.

256
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,250
Yes?

257
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,240
Let me be blunt and honest with you

258
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,660
Here at Khumfah, we appreciate hard working employees

259
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,620
Not the ones who know how to please with sweet talk.

260
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,970
I think you're wasting your time trying to impress me.

261
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,200
Thanks for your time. You can let yourself out.

262
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,570
Sorry that I upset you.

263
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:54,280
But I've just heard so much about you from aunt Lu.

264
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:59,600
Lady Lu who owns the land on Moon Shadow waterfall?

265
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,550
Yes.

266
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,850
Excuse me. Would you two mind waiting outside for a bit?

267
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:21,470
Lady Lu is your aunt?

268
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:26,430
Yes, I'm his nephew by blood

269
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,280
Is there something you want to ask?

270
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,790
Let's get straight to the topic

271
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,360
I want to buy a piece of land on Moon Shadow valley

272
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:41,270
But I've heard it's very difficult to get to Lady Lu

273
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:50,320
Yes. But if you really want it,

274
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:55,520
I guess I could be of help

275
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Only if you hired me

276
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,280
Is that all you want?

277
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,780
Yes, that's all

278
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:10,970
Are you bribing your way into Khumfah?

279
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,320
Well, is that an option?

280
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:22,070
You can start tomorrow

281
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:28,160
}And we'll talk about setting up an appointment with Lady Lu

282
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,080
Sure!

283
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,810
Have you thought of next steps after saving Phupha?

284
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:55,540
Not really. Saving him is my priority. I'll figure out the rest later

285
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,900
You're no different from the other Kram at all. Zero back up plan

286
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:08,560
You sound like you're really close to Kram in this world

287
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:14,190
Tai… Tai

288
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:38,180
Hey! You're not answering my question. Close or not?

289
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,560
Quite close

290
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,180
How close?

291
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,030
Close enough that he pisses me off everyday.

292
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,380
Whining, clumsy, always gets himself into trouble

293
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,560
Sounds more like a complaint than a compliment

294
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:03,850
I adore him anyway.. One of the reasons I'm helping you,

295
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:12,410
is because I miss that Kram I used to know

296
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,840
And you… you're very different from that Thai completely

297
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,710
What's he like, that Tai you know?

298
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,730
He killed my mum

299
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:44,060
Sorry about your mum

300
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,440
That's why you were so threatened when we first met

301
00:41:52,480 --> 00:42:02,340
Yes. But the more I get to know you, I realize you're much nicer

302
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:11,650
Isn't that strange how the two of you could be so different?

303
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,650
Because I got to know you

304
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,700
Pardon?

305
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,330
Don't worry about it

306
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,410
Let's go now. I'm getting hungry now

307
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:48,610
Lady Lu is waiting for us at the fall. But the area is restricted

308
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:53,090
You’ll have to go alone.

309
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,190
Lady Lu wants to speak to you in private

310
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,070
But Mr. Phupha..

311
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,970
It's OK, Wayu. I heard Lady Lu is a very private person

312
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,770
I'll go in there by myself

313
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:25,300
What are you doing? Where's Lady Lu?

314
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,140
She's on her way here

315
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,000
I thought she was already waiting here

316
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:40,100
Give me 5 minutes to explain. Here’s what I’m trying to do

317
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,090
We don’t have time, Mr.Phupha

318
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:47,940
What are you saying?

319
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:48,650
You’re in danger

320
