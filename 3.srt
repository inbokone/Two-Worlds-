1
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,170
You can stay with me if you’ve nowhere to go.

2
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,870
Are you sure.

3
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,720
Until you can find your way back to your world,

4
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,210
I’ll just do what i can to help.

5
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,500
I want to buy a piece of land on Moon Shadow valley.

6
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,470
I heard it’s not simple to reach Lady Lhu.

7
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,050
I think I can help you with that…

8
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,720
only if you let me work here.

9
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,290
What are you doing?

10
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:23,860
Where's Lady Lhu?

11
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,700
She's on her way here.

12
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,700
I thought she was already waiting here.

13
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,000
Give me 5 minutes to explain.

14
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,740
Here’s what I’m trying to do.

15
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,700
We don’t have time, Mr.Phupha.

16
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,450
What are you saying?

17
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,140
You’re in danger.

18
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,820
Let go of me.

19
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,130
Time’s running out, Mr.Phupha.

20
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,970
Hey! Hey!!!

21
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,100
Fuck!

22
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,290
How’s it going?

23
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,380
He wouldn’t say a thing.

24
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,560
Who sent you here!!

25
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,090
Tell me who sent you here!!!!

26
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,990
I….

27
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:10,950
I’ve told you before. I only want to save Phupha

28
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,650
Save Phupha??

29
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,019
Are you fucking kidding me?

30
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,050
Huh.

31
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,040
Wanna try me?

32
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,370
He passed out.

33
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,110
You take care of this.

34
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,620
Call me when you have something.

35
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,090
Yes, sir

36
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,910
Now guys, don’t say a thing about what happened at Moon Shadow fall.

37
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,330
Why?

38
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,610
What do you think?

39
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,900
Wait until we know the whole truth?

40
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,610
Good.

41
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,970
Take care of this.

42
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,300
Wake up asshole!

43
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,580
Can you tell me now?

44
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,450
Tell me!!

45
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,900
Fine!

46
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,400
You wanna try me?

47
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,320
Tell me!!

48
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,690
I don’t think he’ll tell you anything.

49
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,210
You have a better idea?

50
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,670
Ouch! Ouch!

51
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,210
You have to torture him little by little.

52
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,730
Make every second as painful as you can.

53
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,810
Can I try it my way?

54
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,970
Bill is trying to show off.

55
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,430
He can't.

56
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,960
Nopporn wouldn't say a thing. I don't think he'll get anywhere

57
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,050
Ouch,

58
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:57,900
God he's good. I think he'll nail it.

59
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,770
Eh.. But you just said he’s no good.

60
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,100
Hey… I’m not hearing anything in there. Let’s go in! Quick!!

61
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,950
Where is he?

62
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,730
Don’t move!!

63
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,169
Shit!!

64
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,450
Are you ok?

65
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:36,820
I knew something was off….Tai

66
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,000
I knew it. You’re Tai, son of Por of Big Slum gang

67
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,900
Por wants me killed so he sent you here right?

68
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,210
We’ve parted ways long long time ago.

69
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,970
I don’t believe it. Why have you come in disguise then?

70
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,480
Believe it or not, I’m on your side.

71
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,290
Jao!

72
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,200
Don’t move. Hand over your gun….

73
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,160
I said hand over your gun!!!

74
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,120
You’d better watch yourself. Someone’s coming after you.

75
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,820
How could you not tell me!!

76
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,880
You promised you’d tell me everything.

77
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,700
About Kram, who would believe it.

78
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,010
Yeah…you’re right.

79
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,370
He looks exactly like Kram.

80
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,100
Those things only exist in sci-fi movies.

81
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,810
Don’t tell anyone about this.

82
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,320
Yes.

83
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,290
You can go now.

84
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,910
Take your meds and go to rest.

85
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:07,940
Yes.

86
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:12,900
Kram.

87
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,700
Don’t worry about it. Take a good rest

88
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
Thanks.

89
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,050
You’re the only one I trust.

90
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,570
Don’t say that. You’ll come back to me. Promise me.

91
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,330
Promise me?

92
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,280
Umm...

93
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,590
I promise.

94
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,800
Hey.

95
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,680
What do you think you’re doing?

96
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,510
I’m just enjoying the view.

97
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,580
Is there a problem?

98
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,500
I thought you were….

99
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,060
Forget it.

100
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,780
There were times I’ve thought of doing it.

101
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,770
My plans didn’t work out

102
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,190
and I felt so useless.

103
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,280
I feel sorry for having wasted your time.

104
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,660
Sorry.

105
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,380
I don’t think I can save Phupha.

106
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,040
And I don’t think

107
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,370
I can live with that fact.

108
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,100
There’s a place I want to take you to.

109
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,880
Are we expecting to see anyone in particular?

110
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,500
Mum!!

111
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,230
I didn’t know you’re still alive.

112
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,520
Your father died.

113
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,480
But your mum’s still alive. But I felt sorry for you.

114
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,720
You were injured and lost your sight.

115
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,280
Who did it?

116
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,500
The only one I hate the most….my father.

117
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,230
Aunty…

118
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,930
Tai…is that you?

119
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,930
Come….come inside. I’ve prepared food for you.

120
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,910
My friend’s here for a visit.

121
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,380
Come here..come come. Let’s eat. We’ve got plenty of food.

122
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,460
Have some drink first.

123
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,190
Thank you.

124
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,710
Why are you looking away? Say thank you.

125
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,760
Thank you aunty.

126
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,630
Is that Kram? Kram…is that you?

127
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,760
It isn’t Kram.

128
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,820
I’m sorry.

129
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:52,110
But your voice, your face…..you really look like Kram.

130
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,080
But…what’s your name?

131
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,240
My name is…. My name is Nopporn.

132
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,760
Nopporn.

133
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,060
Take it easy!!

134
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,530
I don’t need to be nice!!!

135
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,700
She said she’d return it by month end.

136
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,200
Don’t you get it.

137
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,860
You’ve said month end for so many times now.

138
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,160
When you borrow and don’t give back. That’s called cheating!

139
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,060
You scumbag!

140
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,420
You bitch!

141
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,680
Tai!!

142
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,000
I hope I won’t see you around next time.

143
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:32,950
You got it.

144
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,090
Off you go now!

145
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,650
Thanks Tai.

146
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,040
Boo!

147
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,470
You scared me!

148
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,050
Happy to see me?

149
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,690
Of course.

150
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,540
Who’s that?

151
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,170
My colleague. Looks familiar?

152
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,840
Hello!

153
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,730
Don’t think I’ve seen him before.

154
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,860
Really?

155
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,890
Maybe a neighbor?

156
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,780
Or a family friend?

157
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,090
Nah.

158
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,560
I’ve only had girl friends in my neighborhood.

159
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,370
I only moved here when grandma passed away.

160
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:45,260
Maybe not in this world.

161
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,800
Is he really your colleague?

162
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,720
You’ve never brought anyone home before.

163
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,880
Easy, Dueandao.

164
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,640
Well, you’re trending.

165
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,040
You know when cute guys are together. What do they call it?

166
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,140
Y couple? Something like that.

167
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,850
You got carried away.

168
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,920
Aunty..

169
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,720
Let’s eat. Now that you’re here.

170
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,330
It’s ok. I just wanted to say hi.

171
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,000
Stay.

172
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:30,370
We’ve got more than enough. Come on in. Let’s eat.

173
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:35,140
Come on, Tai. She’s not letting you now, right aunty?

174
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,760
Let’s go. Let’s eat.

175
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:47,330
Sit down, sit down. I’ll take care of everything.

176
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,840
Everything’s so delicious.  Didn’t know you’re such a great cook.

177
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,020
Enjoy. Eat up!

178
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,120
Sure.

179
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,310
Why don’t you eat this.

180
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,000
Thanks.

181
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,910
Nop will help.

182
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,710
OK.

183
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,760
Take this.

184
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,550
Thanks dear.

185
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,460
Why don’t you eat this.

186
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:55,690
Nop will finish last.

187
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,480
You take care of the dishes, ok?

188
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,640
It’s alright. I’ll take care of them.

189
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,090
Nooo

190
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,480
I would have offered if Dueandao didn’t ask.

191
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,190
See?

192
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,860
I’ll do the dishes today.

193
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:19,270
Sure sure. Let’s eat for now. Thanks anyway

194
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,300
Sure.

195
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,400
Are you ok Kram?

196
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,660
Why are you here by yourself?

197
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,200
My rabbit drowned.

198
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,410
I wanted to help but the water ran wild.

199
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:09,560
I couldn’t help it. I’m sorry, mum.

200
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,610
It’s alright, dear. It’s not your fault.

201
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:25,790
How about I do my magic trick?

202
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:32,000
Abracadabra….may all your worries and pain go away.

203
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,110
Feeling better?

204
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:47,010
It’s alright, honey. It’s not your fault at all. Let me give you a big hug.

205
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,820
Are you alright, dear?

206
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,030
I’m ok.

207
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,810
Just thinking of my mum.

208
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,710
She passed away for years now.

209
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,730
Oh…. I’m so sorry to hear that.

210
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,940
It might sound like a coincidence.

211
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,420
But you resemble my mum a lot.

212
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:48,410
Everytime I see you, I can’t stop thinking about her.

213
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:59,450
She’d comfort me everytime that I feel down and I’d feel better.

214
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,900
But she’s not here anymore..

215
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:19,750
Whatever you’d been through…it’s ok. It’s going to be ok

216
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:41,620
Abracadabra….may all your worries and pain go away.

217
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,380
Are you ok?

218
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:18,890
It’s about what Tai said the other day.

219
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:26,390
I’m starting to see it clearer now. It’s weird…in my dreams.

220
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,790
How weird?

221
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,800
It feels like I’ve been betrayed.

222
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,890
Maybe you’re worrying too much.

223
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,330
Hey!

224
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,640
Phupha….Phupha

225
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,900
Hey!

226
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,640
Are you alright, Phupha?

227
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,660
I’m alright. I want to know who he is.

228
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,820
Hey!

229
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,670
No one can come close to Khumfah’s safehouse.

230
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,420
But how did they find out about this place?

231
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,190
Someone close really wants me dead.

232
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,980
What are you going to do now?

233
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:17,210
Can you find out where Tai and Nopporn are?

234
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,970
I want to talk to them.

235
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,490
Yes, sir.

236
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,490
Are you sure you can make it?

237
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,850
Take it easy.

238
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,020
Sorry I kept on talking all night.

239
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,630
Come visit again, Nop?

240
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,080
Sure.

241
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,060
I should excuse myself now.

242
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,480
See you again soon.

243
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,640
Goodnight, aunty.

244
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,200
Goodnight.

245
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,390
Bye, Dueandao.

246
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,600
Bye, Tai.

247
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,380
See you all again soon.

248
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,180
Sure.

249
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:27,000
Are you doing anything later, Tai?

250
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,650
Not really. Why?

251
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:36,860
Can you come with me?  There’s a place I want to take you to.

252
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,650
Why do I have to keep my eyes closed?

253
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,580
We’re almost there.

254
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,540
Follow me. Be careful.

255
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,120
Open your eyes now.

256
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,880
I like taking a walk around here. Beautiful, huh?

257
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,410
Why are we here?

258
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,200
It’s my way of saying thank you…for taking good care of me.

259
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:56,050
You took me to see mum…though she’s not my mum in my world.

260
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:01,710
But to be able to give her a hug again…It made me feel whole lot better.

261
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:17,480
You pay her a visit because you’re close to Kram in this world.

262
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:26,760
So when Kram passes away, you take care of his mum for Kram.

263
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,530
I do the best I can….no matter who it’s for.

264
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,030
I’m grateful for everything you’ve done.

265
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:42,420
You’re one of the nicest people I know.

266
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:29,890
Look at your cheeks. They glow in the dark. So cute!

267
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:31,860
Stop it.

268
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,490
It’s getting late now. Let’s go home.

269
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:44,890
OK.

270
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,210
Wait up.

271
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,840
Hello Phupha..

272
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,220
I’m at Tai’s house now. It must be his.

273
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,240
Sure. I’ll check to make sure again.

274
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,420
Hey! What the hell are you doing here?

275
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,130
I’m here to see Tai.

276
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,400
Who sent you here? You’re looking suspicious.

277
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,330
Tell me who sent you here.

278
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,580
Do you hear me? Hmm?

279
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,969
Sorry if I’m a bit rough.

280
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,389
You want trouble, huh?

281
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,460
Wanna fight?

282
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,960
Stop, Jao. Stop.

283
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:21,639
He almost tried to kill you.

284
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,630
That’s Wayu.

285
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,980
What? Wayu?

286
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,210
Hang on. Who is he?

287
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,320
I’m Jao.

288
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:47,350
Jao. The whining Jao?

289
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,440
Whining?

290
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:57,330
There’s only one person who call me this.

291
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,880
You…the bragging Wayu!!

292
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,980
You’re the whining one.

293
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,880
You’re the bragging one.

294
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,830
You’re the whining one.

295
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,570
You’re the bragging one.

296
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,410
You! The whining Jao

297
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,560
You! The bragging Wayu.

298
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,600
Stop it you two. Stop it!

299
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,190
So you two know each other?

300
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,520
Sorry I was harsh on you.

301
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,340
It’s alright. I’m ok now.

302
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:34,020
You two lived close to each other?

303
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:39,230
Destiny brings you back to meet again.

304
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:45,090
As if I want to see this bragging shit again.

305
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,960
Unlike you the whining asshole.

306
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,970
Wanna fight?

307
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,280
So you know who’s really the whining one.

308
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,380
Calm down you two.

309
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,320
Fight me.

310
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,320
Stop it.

311
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:59,440
So what are you here for, Wayu?

312
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:03,660
Phupha was hit by someone from Khumfah.

313
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,860
And it seems Tai and you might know something about it. Phupha wants to speak to you

314
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,650
You have an idea who it might be?

315
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,470
Not really. Can’t say for sure.

316
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,730
Why me?

317
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,710
Not sure about that either.

318
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,590
WTF. Do you have an idea about anything?

319
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,140
What about you? What do you know?

320
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,310
I wouldn’t ask if I had a clue.

321
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,250
Bloody hell

322
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,050
Hey!

323
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,250
I’m sorry.

324
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:49,130
All I can say is…after Phupha’s father got married to Janda,

325
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,690
There’ll be lots of complications.

326
00:36:54,090 --> 00:37:00,110
Nobody knows about my father getting remarried. How did you know about it?

327
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,160
It’s not difficult for me to find out.

328
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,460
Is there anyone I can trust around here?

329
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:22,330
If we really wanted to take you down, you would’ve been dead.

330
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:27,310
I was so close to you at the company. I had the opportunities to.

331
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:33,560
And would you still be here? Is that enough proof?

332
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:53,030
I’ll try to trust you people.

333
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,700
What are you going to do now?

334
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:02,050
You don’t need to do a thing. Just do your business as usual.

335
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,850
They’ll slowly reveal themselves….

336
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:10,510
Tai and I will take them down when it’s time

337
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,270
This is getting too carried away.

338
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,470
I think…. I will delay Phupha’s succession plan for now

339
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:36,340
Should we send him abroad to keep him safe. Good idea, Phupha?

340
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,080
I think I’ll stay. I will fight them no matter who they are.

341
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,080
What’s up Run?

342
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:01,860
I dropped by to see dad. He said he missed you.

343
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,350
Wanna join us for dinner?

344
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,250
Someone wants to kill Phupha!!

345
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,560
Arghhhh

346
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,400
Hey!!

347
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,150
Run.

348
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,590
Dad.

349
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,820
Are you alright?

350
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,060
Keep it right, dad.

351
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,570
Oyyy!!

352
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,000
Why wouldn’t he stop bleeding??

353
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,650
He has Hemophilia!!!

354
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:07,180
Promise me you’ll keep your Hemophilia a secret.

355
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,930
One day you’ll become the president of Khumfah.

356
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:15,690
No one can know about this, ok?

357
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:20,280
Right. I won’t tell anyone. I promise.

358
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:37,410
Yes. I am your biological father.

359
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:43,480
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to keep it from you.

360
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,880
But your mother begged me to.

361
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,510
How could this be? What happened back then?

362
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:57,710
I used to date your mother.

363
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:02,310
But we had to part ways.

364
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:07,640
Then Rojana got together with Adisak.

365
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:14,750
So mum didn’t know at first I was your son?

366
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:23,880
Yes. until she found out you had Hemophilia.

367
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,050
Then she took a DNA test.

368
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,440
So...

369
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:48,460
That’s how I found out about you

370
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,720
I’m truly sorry.

371
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,840
I should have told you sooner.

372
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:04,220
I am so so sorry.

373
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,760
To me, you’re like a father.

374
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,120
I never once regret it.

375
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,510
Sorry you had to make an escape this way.

376
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,190
Watch out, Phupha!

377
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:45,960
Arghhh!

378
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,440
It’s you again??

379
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,250
Where are you going?

380
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,330
You both stay in the car.

381
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:02,040
What are you doing. Stop Phupha. Stop.

382
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,390
Ouch!!!

383
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,790
Oyy

384
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,190
Uncle!!!

385
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,420
Arghhh

386
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,480
Run away, Run!! Quick!!!

387
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,250
Phupha!

388
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,440
Phupha!!!!

389
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,190
Stay with me Phupha.

390
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:00,230
Stay with me!!

391
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,080
Hey

392
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:19,930
Phupha. Stay with you.

393
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:28,710
You’re gonna be ok. You’re going to be.

394
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,660
Kram…Kram Kram

395
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:39,600
Phupha. Stay with me. Kram

396
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,960
Phupha….Phupha. Stay with me.
