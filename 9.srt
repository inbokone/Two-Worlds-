1
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,000
Kram!!

2
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,250
Kram.

3
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,630
Kram.

4
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,280
Kram.

5
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,890
Kram.

6
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,680
Kram.

7
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,880
Kram, don’t leave me.

8
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,759
You promised me!!

9
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,700
Tai.

10
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,090
Tai!!

11
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,260
What’s wrong?

12
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,640
I can’t sleep.

13
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,060
Can you stay with me?

14
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,060
I’m right here with you.

15
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,220
Not here.

16
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,400
I mean on the bed with me.

17
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,400
What? Are you 8 years old?

18
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,400
Nooo.

19
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,970
I’m only a kid when I’m with you.

20
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,970
Come with me.

21
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,200
Come to bed with me.

22
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,910
Come.

23
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,430
Kram….

24
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,880
Hmm?

25
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,670
Don’t ever leave me again,

26
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,420
OK?

27
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,120
You have my word.

28
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,380
Don’t worry.

29
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,120
We’ve got the best doctor in town to take care of you 24/7.

30
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,279
Kram will be alright,

31
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,080
trust me.

32
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,280
He’s still with us

33
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,220
but Lummana has spreaded.

34
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,340
We hope that he’ll gain his conscious soon.

35
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,240
So there’s a chance he may not wake up?

36
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:50,060
To be honest with you, If he doesn’t gain conscious within these 5 days,

37
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,720
we might lose him.

38
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,290
Day 1

39
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,000
I’ve got your lunch

40
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,170
You eat first,

41
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,630
I’m not hungry yet.

42
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,270
You should eat something,

43
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,270
at least for Kram.

44
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,520
We’re getting close now.

45
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,520
To the left.

46
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,820
Oh Nop.

47
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,920
No this.

48
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,640
what did you to deserve this.

49
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,580
Day 2

50
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,730
I need books on Lummana.

51
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,400
You could look up online.

52
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,760
I’ve tried everything.

53
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,840
Most of them say it can’t be cured.

54
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,220
But I think we can do more.

55
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,220
I can’t just stand and watch and do nothing.

56
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,220
OK.

57
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,970
I’m with you on this.

58
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,320
Day 3

59
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,890
Found it!!

60
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Really?

61
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,840
Blood vessel.

62
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,730
fruit is believed to

63
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,130
help tame down Lummana.

64
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,350
Blood vessel.

65
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,340
They grow well in jungle with birds dropping .

66
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:59,340
And these birds only exist in Rattha.

67
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,210
The condition sounds farfetched!!

68
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,100
The jungle is dangerous by itself.

69
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,680
And who would know where these birds leave their poop?!?

70
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,980
We don’t have time.

71
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,650
We just have to go and find out

72
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,650
Jao!

73
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,770
You’ve got your knife?

74
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,180
Got it.

75
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,480
Mosquito repellent?

76
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,730
Got it.

77
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,730
I’m not a kid!!

78
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,820
To me, you’re the bragging Jao.

79
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,130
Take this firework.

80
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,240
Shoot when you need help.

81
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,600
I’ll be waiting around here.

82
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,140
Thanks.

83
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,150
But I don’t think I’ll be needing this.

84
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,720
Ready?

85
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,500
I’m off now. See ya later.

86
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,130
Yes sir.

87
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,860
Can I borrow your phone?

88
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,310
What for?

89
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:26,780
What do you do?

90
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,480
I want to take your picture.

91
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,360
You look good from here.

92
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,200
No!

93
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,180
Don’t you realize

94
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,180
you got us lost??

95
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,010
I just wandered away.

96
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,360
You’ve never gotten lost?

97
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,640
Let’s take a selfie.

98
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,260
The lighting is about right.

99
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,250
Come on.

100
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,160
No!

101
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,890
Let’s take.

102
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,020
Come on.

103
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
No!/	Smile.

104
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,070
I said smile.

105
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,770
I’ll smile when I want.

106
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,400
Come here.

107
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,420
1 2 3

108
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,520
Enough.

109
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,360
You look a lot cuter when you smile

110
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,870
Look!

111
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,040
This.

112
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,040
Can’t sleep?

113
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,990
Hmm. You?

114
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,160
I can’t sleep either…….

115
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,160
why Kram?

116
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,300
What do you mean?

117
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,770
You’ve given up

118
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,050
and given all just for Kram.

119
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,230
So I want to know.

120
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,250
Why him?

121
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,030
He’s the only one that makes me smile.

122
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,330
He’s like a sunrise,

123
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,280
shining in the dark.

124
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,200
Because Kram

125
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,260
I want to wake up everyday to see him

126
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,940
It’s hard to explain.

127
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,940
One day you’ll understand.

128
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,520
One day when you meet someone who makes you feel at ease.

129
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,350
And you want to spend the rest of your life with them.

130
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,220
Day 4

131
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,220
Tai is trying his best for you.

132
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,130
You should try your best too.

133
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,190
Please take care

134
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,880
If something happens to me,

135
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,410
promise me you’ll take the best care of Kram

136
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:28,860
Sure.

137
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,290
I promise.

138
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,680
But promise me you’ll come back and pick him up by yourself.

139
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,290
Wake up!

140
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,800
Everyone’s waiting for you, Kram.

141
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,390
What should we do?

142
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,090
We’ve looked everywhere.

143
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,120
Damn!!

144
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,280
Book says Blood vessel fruit grows well in the right temperature.

145
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,830
Not too hot, not too cold.

146
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,550
A place that receives both cold wind and sun.

147
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,290
It's a cliff.

148
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,200
Watch out Tai!

149
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,240
Be careful!

150
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,710
Let me help.

151
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,420
Are you OK?

152
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,860
Let’s head back now.

153
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,180
Let’s go.

154
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,180
Ouch!!

155
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,240
Hey.

156
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,750
Jao!

157
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,390
What happened? Are you OK?

158
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,370
I’m OK

159
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,000
I’ll go help.

160
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,450
Don’t worry. You go and help Kram.

161
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,740
I’m OK.

162
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,550
How can I leave you here?

163
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,200
You go ahead. We have no time.

164
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,080
You go save Kram.

165
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,280
Don’t worry about me.

166
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,200
Ouch!!

167
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,300
Fuck!

168
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,320
Shit!! I must use it.

169
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,160
Hey Tai! How are you?

170
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,320
Take the mask out.

171
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,160
When is Wayu gonna get here?

172
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,160
I’m hungry now.

173
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,560
Ouch!!

174
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,560
What are you whining about?

175
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,810
Fuck!

176
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,040
You bragger!

177
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,240
When I use it, you must come.

178
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,370
Why are you so late?

179
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,270
Sure.

180
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,950
Want me to come back tomorrow?

181
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,950
Hey hey!!

182
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:48,880
Are you leaving for real? Wayu!

183
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,360
You loser!!

184
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,030
Help me out here.

185
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,790
I’m starving!!

186
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,920
You wait right here

187
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,290
Where are you going now?

188
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,820
Come back first!!!

189
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,790
Ouch!!

190
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,600
Wayu.

191
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,190
Wayu.

192
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,090
OK OK. Here I am

193
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,590
I’m sorry.

194
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,650
Why do you look so pale?

195
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,400
You’ve got a fever!

196
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,190
Why didn’t you tell me??

197
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,000
Shit!!

198
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,590
Leave me alone.

199
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,940
Jao…

200
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,040
Jao!! Hey!!

201
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,270
Kram.

202
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,030
It’s OK, Kram.

203
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:53,860
Are you having bad dreams?  I’m right here with you.

204
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,360
I promise.

205
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,620
Tai.

206
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,780
You’re up!

207
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,660
Am I dreaming?

208
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,970
I don’t only exist in dreams.

209
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,640
No. Seriously.

210
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,440
Why do you look puzzled?

211
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,600
You passed out during Ash exchange ceremony

212
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,060
The doctor said you could only live for 5 more days.

213
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,480
So I …..

214
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
But I’m still here.

215
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,550
I’m not gonna die.

216
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,450
I won’t let you die alone.

217
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,230
Who knows.

218
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,610
I might be gone tomorrow.

219
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,560
I gave you my promise to stay with you.

220
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:16,270
You too have to promise me you won’t give up

221
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,320
We’ll fight everything together.

222
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:43,790
Kram.

223
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,740
Kram.

224
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,540
Kram. What’s wrong?

225
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,570
Doctor!

226
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,570
Doctor.

227
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,750
Help!

228
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,310
Kram.

229
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,080
Kram.

230
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,090
Kram.

231
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,040
Kram.

232
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,360
Kram.

233
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,360
Kram.

234
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,910
Why is he not moving, doc?

235
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,380
Doctor.

236
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:28,810
Kram.

237
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:46,920
Kram.

238
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,550
Kram.

239
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,580
Kram.

240
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,090
Kram.

241
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,400
Kram.

242
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,760
Whose house is this?

243
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,140
Excuse me. Anyone home?

244
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,140
Can we come in?

245
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,570
Have some water

246
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,570
Thanks

247
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,280
Kram.

248
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,650
Made some soup for you.

249
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,360
Thanks Phupha.

250
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:50,620
How’s Jao? Do you know how he’s doing?

251
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,280
Don’t worry about him.

252
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,640
Thank you all so much.

253
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,220
I’ve troubled all of you big time.

254
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,700
Everyone’s more than happy to keep you safe.

255
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:16,840
Hi, aunty Lhu.

256
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,200
Can I speak to Kram?

257
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,320
Aunty Lhu wants to speak to you.

258
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,500
Aunty Lhu?

259
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,120
Hi!

260
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,360
Yes.

261
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,790
You had bad dreams too?

262
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,330
No.

263
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,760
I dreamed of my childhood days.

264
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,340
You pushed me over!

265
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,050
No! It’s you!

266
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,880
It’s you!

267
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,180
You pushed me over first.

268
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,300
When we met.

269
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,420
I dreamed of that time too.

270
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,920
Let me ask you something.

271
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,500
The day I fell into the water,

272
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,610
did you give me CPR?

273
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,130
How did you find out?

274
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,660
I could feel

275
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,590
someone kissing me.

276
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,910
And you didn’t mind?

277
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,830
No!

278
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,980
You saved my life..

279
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,630
Relly?

280
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,310
But I was disgusted.

281
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,100
Why?

282
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,890
You’re the first that made me cry.

283
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,000
I’m sorry that I have to leave.

284
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,430
I can’t stay to protect you anymore.

285
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,730
But you made a promise.

286
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,720
I have to relocate with my family.

287
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,720
What do you want from me, weepy head?

288
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,660
I know I’m the weepy one. But I’m not a bragger like you.

289
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,150
You broke your promise.

290
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,830
Just go! Do what you want!!

291
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,540
Do you know how long it took to get over you?

292
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:03,910
Why?

293
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,850
Why did you come back

294
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
to complicate things again?

295
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,120
Aunty.

296
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,880
Nop is up, aunty.

297
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,330
Really?

298
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,450
Mom!!

299
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:40,120
Oh Nop. I thought I’d never see you again

300
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,080
I know my loved ones were wait for me.

301
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,190
Why won't I recover?

302
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:52,520
Are you hungry? I made you

303
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,520
It’s you favorite?

304
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,030
I’ve told you it’s my favorite?

305
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:08,320
Thank you. Dad always makes it for me too.

306
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,090
How’s your father doing?

307
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,190
I haven’t seen him for months too

308
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,280
But I remember

309
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,990
him having problems with his sight.

310
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,770
He still enjoys painting a lot.

311
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,360
And though he complains from time to time about his back pain,

312
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:47,860
he still gets up to cook for me.

313
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,580
Mom.

314
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,750
Why are you crying?

315
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,580
Nothing.

316
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,850
I’m glad to hear he’s doing OK.

317
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,560
I'm happy.

318
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,740
Hey.

319
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,270
You know my father too?

320
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,270
We’re very very close.

321
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,950
Kram.

322
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,670
You know…?

323
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:49,690
I always notice you have a lot in common with Kram.

324
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,930
In fact,

325
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,800
Nop is Kram…

326
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,880
but not the exact same Kram who’s my son, right?

327
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:07,110
Yes…I am Kram.

328
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,650
But I come from a different place.

329
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,350
And now I’m unsure

330
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,050
whether to go back there.

331
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,350
No matter what decision you take,

332
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:30,370
I believe you’ll pick the best one

333
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:32,640
Right?

334
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,760
Now let me give you a hug.

335
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,760
I want to hug you too.

336
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,350
Oh you make me so so happy.

337
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,520
Me too.

338
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,640
So you’ll go back there no matter what?

339
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:04,580
Yes.

340
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,300
I’ve made up my mind.

341
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,410
I’ll come with you too.

342
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:18,840
We made a pact no matter what happens, we’ll take care of each other til the day we die.

343
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,230
But if you come with me…

344
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,820
No matter what.

345
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,840
What if the water doesn’t turn blue ever again,

346
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,430
we won’t see each other.

347
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,840
Let me go with you.

348
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,150
I’ve already made up my mind.

349
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,850
Lady Lhu told me

352

Hello aunty Lhu.

353
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,190
It will be a full moon night the night after tomorrow.

354
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,510
The water will turn blue again

355
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,340
around 11 o’clock.

356
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:35,360
Yes.

357
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,340

359
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,670

Whenever one crosses over the boundary and finds oneself on the
other side,

361
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:06,010
they would hear the squeaky sound that  tortures them to death.

362
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:12,670
And there’s nothing they can do about it.

363
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:34,290
This is the only way to happiness for everyone.

364
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,620
I’ll go back to where I belong.

365
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,840
You should be in your place.

366
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,800
We shouldn’t be together.

367
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:54,880
I don’t think I can stand seeing you cross the boundary then die right before my eyes.

368
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:05,500
So they say happy times fly fast

369
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,470
It might be too late before we know it

370
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:12,260
Kram!!

371
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:19,960
I missed the chance to tell you

372
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,630
how much I love you

373
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,380
I’m so sorry, Tai

374
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:32,510
If I said I love you.

375
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:39,240
If destiny doesn’t part our ways

376
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:46,040
If you’re still here with me. 		/ Kram!! Kram!!! Krammmm!!!!

377
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:54,880
I wonder if our hearts want the same thing

378
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,680
Kram!! Kram!!! Krammmm!!!!
