1
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,920
This is the only way to happiness for everyone.

2
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,920
I’ll go back to where I belong.

3
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,190
Krammmm.

4
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,780
I should stay where I belong.

5
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,530
We both should part ways and stay where we belong.

6
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,280
Sorry, Tai.

7
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,930
- I can’t take it.
- Kram.

8
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,570
I don’t think I can stand seeing you cross the boundary

9
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,260
Kramm.

10
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,880
then die right before my eyes.

11
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,320
Kramm.

12
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,600
Kram.

13
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,810
Dad!

14
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,730
Sorry, dad.

15
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,880
I’m back now.

16
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,020
Long time no see.

17
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,330
You’ve grown a lot.

18
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,800
I’ve missed you lots.

19
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,460
I’ve missed you too.

20
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,760
Crossed the boundary? Are you for real?

21
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,280
Yup.

22
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,570
It’s just like the world we’re living in. But they’re not us.

23
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,120
People there have helped me a great deal.

24
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,280
So much I don’t even know how I can pay them back.

25
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,280
You must have seen and been through a lot.

26
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,410
I’ve saved Phupha in that world.

27
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,190
Good on you.

28
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,370
You have really grown up, son.

29
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:19,900
Breaking news! Police have successfully purged and taken control over Por’s casino.

30
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,430
However, since there was shooting in the scene,

31
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,520
The casino was on fire.

32
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,220
Por himself had been executed.

33
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,800
and his son, known under the name of ‘Tai’ had made an escape.

34
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:38,770
Witnesses said Tai was seen wounded from the fire.

35
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,180
If you had seen him, reporting tips to police will be appreciated.

36
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,180
Jao!

37
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,180
Hey!!

38
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,260
Why don’t you take your shirt off first? You’d get sick.

39
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,220
I can just do this with my shirt on.

40
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,490
It’s so so cold.

41
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:08,050
Dad would do this whenever I have bad dreams.

42
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,050
It’s like a dream catcher.

43
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:12,910
Thank you.

44
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,680
Tai.

45
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,810
Tai.

46
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,140
Tai.

47
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,020
I wasn’t gonna do anything to you

48
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,840
I just want to give you the pills.

49
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,670
It will get worse if you don’t take these pills.

50
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,670
What do you want!

51
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,760
I…I…

52
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,950
I’m just worried about you.

53
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,820
Exchange ceremony.

54
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,190
I….I’ll leave the pills here, ok?

55
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,240
I brought you food.

56
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,270
You should eat something.

57
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,390
I put the rest here.

58
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,990
Why the hell did you save me?

59
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,100
I really owe it to you.

60
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,100
Since when did I ever help you?

61
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,290
If I told you the truth, would you agree to eat something?

62
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,290
I’ll take that as a yes.

63
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,110
I have crossed over to the other world with the power of Moon Shadow.

64
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,370
We are acquainted in that world.

65
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,370
You’re really kind to me.

66
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
But when I came back here into this world,

67
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,830
I realize I want to help you out as much as I can….to pay you back.

68
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,950
You think I’m a kid?

69
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,400
Well, I’ve answered your question.

70
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,780
If you don’t want to eat, then that’s fine.

71
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,580
Does it hurt again?

72
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,240
Can you please help clean and dress it up?

73
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,660
Do you trust me now?

74
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,460
Quick!

75
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,270
I’ve brought clothes for you to change.

76
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,180
How did you know I’m here?

77
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,720
I come here with you all the time in the other world.

78
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,380
Can you stop lying about this?

79
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,090
You asked me yourself!

80
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,580
And what are you doing here.

81
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,970
Here often?

82
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,240
Well……I guess

83
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,110
Quick!

84
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,980
You just lied to me right?

85
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,940
I spend a lot of time with Tai in another world.

86
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,450
I would know.

87
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,010
When you lie me.

88
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,140
Stop talking sloppy.

89
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,720
Get it done quickly.

90
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:27,560
Tai

91
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:30,790
What’s up?

92
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,480
Nothing.

93
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,600
I thought I saw another one of you just now.

94
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,070
You should see a doctor.

95
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,690
You were coughing all night.

96
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,760
You have Lummana, right?

97
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,190
How did you know?

98
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,700
My mum died from it too.

99
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,480
Only Blood Vessel fruit can help.

100
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,760
But they’re very rare.

101
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,830
I was too young to hunt for them.

102
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,630
So Mum passed away before I could find them.

103
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,990
If the time is now, do you think you’d be able to find them?

104
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,450
Sure!

105
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,700
But I won’t share any with you.

106
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,060
You’re not family.

107
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,120
But we are in another world already.

108
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,210
…No.

109
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,580
We’ve exchanged ash too.

110
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,150
Wouldn't you help me?

111
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,720
What are you laughing about?

112
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,600
You’re no different no matter where you are.

113
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,470
Always hard to express your feelings.

114
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,980
You might look different on the outside.

115
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,460
But your heart’s the same.

116
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,970
I know you wouldn't believe it anyway.

117
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,630
Let’s go eat now. I’m hungry.

118
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,830
Actually, I’ve never asked you about it in another world too.

119
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,130
What’s your mother like?

120
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,760
Can you tell me more about her?

121
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,760
Why should I?

122
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,260
We don’t have much else to do around here.

123
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,480
But that’s up to you,

124
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,400
You can just sit here and bore yourself out.

125
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,400
My mum was kind.

126
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,800
I got beaten up by dad almost everyday.

127
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,020
Mum was the only one who consoled me.

128
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,360
Mums are like that.

129
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,120
My mum consoles me

130
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,400
whenever dad scolds me too.

131
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,250
I’m sorry.

132
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,770
What for?

133
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,480
Sorry your mum died.

134
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,300
Can I ask you something?

135
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,100
You’re not the one who killed my mum right?

136
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,580
What makes you think so?

137
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,840
The more I know you in another world,

138
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,540
I’ve become more certain that.

139
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,400
You’re not that kind of person.

140
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
Can you tell me the truth of

141
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,250
what happened to my mum?

142
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,790
I didn’t mean for it to happen

143
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,600
When are you going to pay back?

144
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,610
I’m really all out this month. Can I take a raincheck?

145
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,680
No!

146
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,720
Ouch!!!

147
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,780
What the hell!!

148
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,400
Next time don’t do anything if I don’t ask you do.

149
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,030
Mum!!

150
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,580
Mum.

151
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,690
Mum.

152
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,030
Mum.

153
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,480
i give you 1 more week. Find the money and pay us back.

154
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,620
I’m really sorry.

155
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,500
Would you stop drawing already.

156
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,470
I told dad I was out drawing.

157
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,900
He’ll suspect something if I go back empty-handed.

158
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,520
You only paint landscapes?

159
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,430
I do portraits too.

160
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,110
I’m drawing you right now.

161
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,110
Ouch!!!

162
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,740
You haven’t asked for my permission!

163
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,640
Don’t play hard on me.

164
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,920
There’s nothing else to do around here anyway.

165
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,400
Do whatever you want then.

166
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,390
Ouch!!

167
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,240
Oiii….

168
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,670
gentle!!

169
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,930
OK.

170
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,930
What are you drawing?

171
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,410
Here. Come over here.

172
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,470
Can you see right here?

173
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,880
The lighting is about right.

174
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,130
You can render this part for shading.

175
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,130
You should go to sleep.

176
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,700
Just a bit more.

177
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,450
You should take a rest. Come on.

178
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,130
Kram.

179
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,330
Kram.

180
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,330
Kram.

181
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,350
Kram.

182
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,790
Kram.

183
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,540
How about this?

184
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,170
Is this close enough?

185
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,750
Book says Blood vessel fruit grows well

186
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,620
in the right temperature

187
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,090
Not too hot, not too cold.

188
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,500
It should be exposed to light and wind.

189
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,500
They’re best when found on the cliff.

190
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:48,320
You asked me if I’ve ever come here before, right?

191
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,440
In fact, i’ve never been here before

192
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,560
but somehow there’s something

193
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,810
that draws me here.

194
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,290
So you should wake up now.

195
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,690
I want to hear your story of another.

196
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,360
Thanks, Tai

197
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,990
Tai.

198
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,350
Tai.

199
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,980
Tai.

200
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,030
Tai.

201
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,280
Tai.

202
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,690
Tai.

203
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,830
No…no.

204
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,160
Not like this.

205
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,890
Tai.

206
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,080
Tai.

207
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,680
Tai.

208
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,770
Not like this, Tai.

209
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,100
Not like this.

210
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:21,460
Kram.

211
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,190
Kram.

212
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,960
Kram.

213
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:18,480
Tai.

214
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,920
Tai. Is that really you?

215
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,900
Sorry I’m late.

216
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,420
But I’m keeping my promise.

217
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,640
Here I am now.

218
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,640
I won’t go anywhere from now on.

219
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:56,480
If I said I love you

220
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:04,000
If destiny doesn’t part our ways

221
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:10,490
If you’re still here with me

222
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:20,500
I wonder if our hearts want the same thing

223
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:30,940
The blue substance comes from the power of black stone.

224
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,250
Once you break the black stone,

225
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,150
the blue substance inside will appear.

226
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,890
But if you damage the black stone,

227
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:45,300
blue substance will also forever be gone.

228
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,470
I cannot live a life with Kram.

229
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:26,630
Do you think we could cross over to the other world if we jumped?

230
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:34,910
We will never part - not in this world or any other world.

231
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,430
This Ash Exchange represents a promise.

232
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,090
I will find you wherever you may be - in this world or any other world

233
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,440
And I will forever love this Kram - no matter where we’d be.

234
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:03,780
I’ve found old pictures of you.

235
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,010
But who were these 2?

236
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,010
They don’t look familiar to me.

237
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,430
What are we having today?

238
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,610
Fish porridge.

239
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,150
Ooh…my favorite!

240
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:15,430
Your favorite? It’s actually MY favorite!

241
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
What’s yours is mine too.

242
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,240
Almost finished?

243
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,450
I’ve just started.  Maybe 10 more minutes.

244
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:32,890
We can do so much in 10 minutes.

245
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,540
It’s been 10 years? Haven’t you had enough?

246
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,540
Never.

247
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,770
Don’t believe ya.

248
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:10,400
So they say happy times fly fast

249
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:17,540
It might be too late before we know

250
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:30,470
I missed the chance to tell you how much I love you

251
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:37,300
If I said I love you.

252
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:44,240
If destiny doesn’t part our ways

253
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:50,940
If you’re still here with me

254
00:48:50,960 --> 00:49:00,640
I wonder if our hearts want the same thing

255
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:10,670
I don’t want to be in a world without you

256
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:17,660
Only if I could turn back time. Only if I got to see you one more time

257
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:26,960
Don’t want to be in a dream that would never come true

258
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:44,430
Only if I could turn back time. Only if I got to see you one more time

259
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:54,800
Don’t want to be in a dream that would never come true
