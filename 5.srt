1
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,820
You have to pick who’ll go out alive now.

2
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,770
I’m sorry.

3
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,200
Tai.

4
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,880
I told you I’d stay with you.

5
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,500
I’ll stay no matter what.

6
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,680
You should get some rest.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,680
What about you?

8
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,680
I’ll go out and get some food for us.

9
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,940
I don’t want to be alone. I’m scared.

10
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,670
I’ll stay til you fall asleep then.

11
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,280
Promise?

12
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,960
Hmm… Now get some rest.

13
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,180
I used to stay here from time to time so there’s some stuff here.

14
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,420
You don’t like rice soup?

15
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,190
Nah.

16
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,279
I want to know what happened

17
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,839
before you came to save me.

18
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,000
Por forced me to work for him.

19
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,240
He used the opportunity to hold you and Phupha in ransom.

20
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,960
Now I’m just trying to get back at him.

21
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,820
Target’s arrived. He’s got a tattoo on his right arm.

22
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,460
Let’s go. Here he comes

23
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,890
Onto the next plan!

24
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,300
Jao!

25
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:30,370
Believe me he’d say I’ve been drinking and hungover.

26
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,280
Tai! This is Por’s plan.

27
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,060
He’s using us.

28
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,680
What do you mean?

29
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,680
He knows he’s helping Phupha to escape.

30
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,570
He tricked you into doing that job…taking me into ransom.

31
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,770
But I made an escape.

32
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,190
He must be on his way to get Phupha and Kram.

33
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,060
This is Bank - son of Gen. Kriangkrai.

34
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,890
Good job! I knew you’d make it.

35
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,640
Piak, film this!

36
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,500
I’ve got something I want to send to Kriangkrai.

37
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,590
How do you feel now huh?

38
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,790
Heard you’re coming after me?

39
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,750
Just watch this.

40
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,260
Your son’s with me now.

41
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,420
But don’t worry. I’m not gonna hurt him

42
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,510
only if you leave me alone.

43
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,170
Hang on. I think I might want to change my mind.

44
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,740
Haha.

45
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,290
I want to see your face when you get to see this .

46
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,540
How you’d feel seeing your son dying in front of you.

47
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,310
Fuck!

48
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,390
He’s not Bank! This is Ton, son of the boss.

49
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,890
Tai. Are you sure? You’re messing with the big boss!

50
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,120
Who’s the big boss?

51
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:46,130
You stupid shit. He’s the one behind gray businesses in Rattha

52
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,790
Even Por is threatened by this guy.

53
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:52,390
Why didn’t you tell me sooner! I should have stopped Tai!!!

54
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,360
Trust me this is the only way we can stop Por.

55
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,900
How?

56
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,610
What’s your plan?

57
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,500
This guy looks nothing like him.

58
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,400
He can tell in a split second.

59
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
It’s your job to make them look alike.

60
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,480
OK. Let’s see what I can do.

61
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:42,049
Shit!! You…Tai!!! Catch him.

62
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,850
Where are they now? Follow them!!!

63
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,800
Now you know what took me so long.

64
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,810
Sorry. I didn’t know..

65
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,070
It’s alright.

66
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,380
Now eat. It won’t taste as good when it gets cold.

67
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,380
OK.

68
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,040
I’m cold.

69
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,360
Take this.

70
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,610
What about you?

71
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,740
I’m OK.

72
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,530
No. You’ll get sick. Let’s tuck under this blanket together.

73
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,790
Come on. I’d feel better this way.

74
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,080
You’ve already helped me a great deal.

75
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,060
This reminds me of the old times -

76
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,880
staying near the fireplace next to someone .

77
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,440
That ‘someone’ is Phupha?

78
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,180
With my dad.

79
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,480
There was a day I went drawing with my dad in the jungle.

80
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,940
We stayed until late

81
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,930
and couldn’t find our way out.

82
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,560
So we sat next to the fireplace together.

83
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,060
It was warm

84
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:38,220
and….

85
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,430
Tai, what happened to your face?

86
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,390
My friend picked on him.

87
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,240
Is it the one that teases you about your mum?

88
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,330
Yes.

89
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,540
Come here.

90
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Why did you let him bully you?

91
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,250
I beat you because you’re hopeless.

92
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,100
You make a choice - hit him back and let me beat you up.

93
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,590
I don’t want to hurt him.

94
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,120
Bad dreams?

95
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,120
Did  I wake you up?

96
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,530
No. But did you have a bad dream?

97
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,410
No

98
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,570
Now you’re lying again.

99
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,170
Why do you always have to lie?

100
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,170
What now?

101
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:45,460
Whenever I have a bad dream, dad would do this to ease it away.

102
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,030
No need.

103
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,860
You’ve done so much for me. Don’t worry.

104
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,880
You won’t have bad dreams again tonight.

105
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,880
Thanks.

106
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:12,760
Hmm.

107
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,650
Tai? Is that you?

108
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,800
Where’s Tai?

109
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:51,200
w…w…what? I….I…I don’t know.

110
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,730
Stop lying! Tell me where he is.

111
00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:00,200
Hey!! What are you doing here?

112
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,040
Get out! I said get out!!! You can’t go upstairs.

113
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,220
Get down! Where do you think you’re going

114
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,040
Stop! I’ll call the police if you don’t!

115
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,290
Where’s Tai? Hmm?

116
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,860
We really don’t know.

117
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,320
I’ll ask you just one more time. Where’s Tai!!!

118
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,480
That’s it?

119
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,480
I’m full now.

120
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,329
Full?

121
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,540
I must be such a bad cook, babe.

122
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,880
What did you just call me?

123
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,840
You call?

124
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,840
You can throw it in the bin if you don’t want to eat it.

125
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:44,670
No! Don’t! I’m still eating it.

126
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,340
You don’t have to. You’re already full. Just throw it out.

127
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,300
I still want to eat.

128
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,520
Please. Pleaseeeee..

129
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,750
I said you don’t have to.

130
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:09,090
I want to. Your fried rice is the best.

131
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,540
Let me eat it. Please. Pleaseeee.

132
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,420
- I’m gonna throw it out
- Hey ! Tai.

133
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,330
I’m gonna throw it out.

134
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,390
I can eat it outside.

135
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:22,960
No.

136
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,680
- It’s dark now. When can I have it?
-		I said you can’t have it.

137
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,180
Hello son.

138
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
Run away!

139
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,770
Just run!!!

140
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,770
Quick !!

141
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,200
Don’t mess with my people .

142
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,720
What would you do to me huh?

143
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,710
Don’t be such a coward.

144
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,870
Don’t miss this one like you did 3 years ago.

145
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,680
Kram.

146
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,680
3 years ago

147
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,540
Kram.

148
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,250
Kram.

149
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,800
Kram.

150
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,250
Kram.

151
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:15,400
Kram.

152
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,910
Kram.

153
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,380
Kram… what happened?

154
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,720
Tai

155
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,040
Kram.

156
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,540
Kram.

157
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,860
Kram.

158
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,700
Kram.

159
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,990
Kram.

160
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,990
Kram.

161
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,030
Kram.

162
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,030
Krammm.

163
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,320
Why did  you have to kill Kram?

164
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,920
Why the hell did you shoot them?

165
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,500
OK so I killed Kram. Got a problem?

166
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,600
Why!!!!

167
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,600
Because they make you weak.

168
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,230
Kill me!

169
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,620
So you can become the big boss.

170
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,890
Trade my life with you growing up. Do you think it’s worth it?

171
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,070
I’ll never become who you want me to be.

172
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,060
You and me….it’s over!!

173
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,070
Arghhh!!!

174
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:54,070
If you don’t do it, someone will do it to you.

175
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,300
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

176
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,130
Arghhh!!

177
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,160
I give you one last chance.

178
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,930
Just give in.

179
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,340
You…you!!

180
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,020
You’re not going to give it huh?

181
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,610
Arghhh!!

182
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:36,320
Men don’t cry.

183
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,310
Arghhh!!

184
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:44,040
Keep this in mind. Whoever tries to fuck me up,

185
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,850
You’ll have take it the hard way - even my own son.

186
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,570
Please leave him alone.

187
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,860
He’d saved us many many times. Please.

188
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,470
Please.

189
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,200
No more problem around here, I guess.

190
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,040
I’ve been worrying about you! Where have you been?

191
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,200
You had trouble with Por? What happened?

192
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,010
I’m sorry. I don’t know what to say.

193
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,710
What am I supposed to do about this.

194
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,020
I said no!!

195
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,320
Phupha. Phupha

196
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,930
I don’t care!!

197
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,590
Phupha. Phupha.

198
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,920
I’m really sorry. I’ve tried to stop them.

199
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,740
Jao, what happened?

200
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,630
I need to talk to you. It’s urgent.

201
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,250
Kram’s going to be executed?

202
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,910
What’s with Por?

203
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,910
This isn’t ancient time.

204
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,190
Luckily I escaped and found Jao.

205
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,460
I want to ask for Phupha’s help.

206
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,650
I really want to help but I’ve got a lot on my shoulders.

207
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,100
Tai got the big boss’s son killed.

208
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,280
If something else happens, Khumfah will be in trouble too..

209
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,140
No need to worry about that. Tai has it all planned out.

210
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,230
How?

211
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,260
Por had his people filming when he killed boss’s son.

212
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,200
Though it’s been deleted,

213
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,190
I know you can it back.

214
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:57,850
Sure. I’ll have my guy deliver it. Same place? Sure

215
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,620
Hey…I told you. They’ll pick it up at the back for sure.

216
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,350
You should get going now before they find out.

217
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,170
I wouldn’t have asked you to bring a laptop

218
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,350
if I wanted just a phone.

219
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,800
You stupid! This is for emergencies.

220
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,480
Haven’t you heard of a back up plan?

221
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,350
Shit! That’s clever.

222
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,390
Never knew you could come up with such idea.

223
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,220
Let’s go now.

224
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,080
Piak!

225
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,810
Fuck!

226
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,860
Piak!!!

227
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,370
You said he wouldn’t be here today.

228
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,300
Jao! Jao!!

229
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,230
มึงเข้ามาทำไมเนี่ยHow did you get in here asshole!!

230
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,180
Asshole!!

231
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,260
Oyyy!!

232
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,380
Next one is on you. Why  are you here?

233
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,380
I’m here to get Piak’s phone.

234
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,950
I want to recover that clip of you shooting boss’s son.

235
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,930
You bastard!!

236
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,890
You tried to mess with me behind my back huh?

237
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,420
I didn’t have to.

238
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,790
Wanna fight? Huh? Huh?

239
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:13,520
Save it for hell.

240
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,940
You’re the one dying and going to hell, not me.

241
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,080
What the fuck!.

242
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,910
I want to see your expression when you get to see this.

243
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,120
How you’d react to see your son dying right in front of you.

244
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,550
Por went behind your back. He wants to take over Rattha.

245
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,860
Your son found out about it so they had to kill him.

246
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,500
We share the same goal.

247
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,920
I want to take down the one who took the life of your son.

248
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,380
Fuck him Por!!! He bloody killed my son!!!

249
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,900
Boss.

250
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,740
Calm down.

251
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,100
Take it easy.

252
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,300
Take it easy?

253
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Why did you kill my son?

254
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,200
There’s some minor misunderstanding.

255
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,300
I beg you. Please don’t kill me.

256
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,050
Misunderstanding?

257
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,850
Then you need to explain to me. What the fuck happened huh?

258
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,480
It was my fault. I didn’t mean it to happen.

259
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:53,900
I’m truly sorry. It was my fault. But please don’t kill me.

260
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,630
Fuck you! Whooo.

261
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:51,920
You made me do this.

262
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,140
Now shoot me!

263
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,380
Great. So I killed the big boss. I can’t run away now.

264
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:16,580
You make it look like you’ve taken care of it.

265
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,980
Please don’t hurt me. Please. I beg you.

266
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,900
Please let me go.

267
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:34,570
I beg you. Don’t kill me, please.

268
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,100
Please let me go.

269
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,880
Don’t kill me, please.

270
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:45,360
When are you gonna do it?

271
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,170
Dad.

272
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,800
First step is always the hardest.

273
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,180
- Hey hey hey
- 	Take a deep breath.

274
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:05,020
Hold your gun tightly…and shoot.

275
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,220
D….Don’t!!

276
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,170
I can’t do it.

277
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,250
You disappoint me to the last minute.

278
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:43,620
Big slum gang is now yours, son.

279
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,270
What are you doing here?

280
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,020
I miss mum.

281
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,710
Tell me the truth. What really happened?

282
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,720
They teased me about not having a mother.

283
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,700
What do you do when a mosquito bites you?

284
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,160
Kill it.

285
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,780
Yes, kill it.

286
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:30,180
Because if you don’t, it will keep bothering you.

287
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:37,640
But the teacher says we shouldn’t bully our friends.

288
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,140
There’s no such thing as friendship.

289
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,660
One day you’ll be taking over my place.

290
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,920
You need to learn how to keep them under your feet.

291
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:55,950
I’m sorry about your father.

292
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,020
No need.

293
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,280
He’s not my father any more.

294
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,420
Tai.

295
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,450
What are you doing?

296
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:03,120
I just want to cheer you up.

297
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,160
I said I’m OK.

298
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,720
At the very least, he brought you up.

299
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,740
I understand if you’d be upset and disappointed.

300
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,420
That kinda guy?

301
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,580
Crying? Again? Such a wuss.

302
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,450
How many times do I have to tell you this.

303
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,660
Go to bed now!

304
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,420
Go!!!

305
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,570
I said go!!!!

306
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,080
He misses you a lot…..

307
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:56,880
and me too.

308
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:08,920
But don’t worry. I’ll teach him to become a real man.

309
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,600
I told you to go to bed. Why are you still up?!?

310
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,920
Let me tell you this.

311
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,450
When my mum died,

312
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,920
I came to her grave everyday.

313
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,000
He was pissed.

314
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,570
He kept telling me to stop crying..

315
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:41,290
But you what?

316
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,940
He was also crying too.

317
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,590
Tai….

318
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,370
It’s a funny story.

319
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,930
I know he’s never been a good man throughout his life.

320
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,700
But I can still remember the day I hugged him….right there.

321
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,470
I should be happy that he’s dead.

322
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,160
But I don’t know why I’m this sad.

323
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,980
I’ll stay right here with you no matter what.

324
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:06,200
If there’s anything I can do to make you feel better,

325
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:12,980
just tell me. I’ll do anything.
