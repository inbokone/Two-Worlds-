1
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,500
Kram…join me in an Ash Exchange ceremony.

2
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,490
You don’t have to decide now.

3
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,789
I know you have a lot on your mind.

4
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,050
I can wait.

5
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,180
This is beautiful!

6
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,350
Hmm..That’s why I want to bring you here.

7
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,450
Kram.

8
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,340
I want to take us to another level.

9
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,310
Would you go out with me?

10
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,930
I thought we’re already going out.

11
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,360
Well, then it means….

12
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:29,800
Hmm.

13
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,480
Kram….

14
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,820
Thank you. Thank you so much.

15
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,670
Drink lots of water.

16
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,390
Thanks.

17
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,610
Do you have to be somewhere?

18
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,620
Why?

19
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,159
Can you tell me why you saved me?

20
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:53,070
Will you believe in everything I’m about to tell you?

21
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,140
I have come from another parallel world

22
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,070
It looks a lot like this…

23
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,410
but it’s not this world.

24
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,490
In that world….

25
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,490
we are in love.

26
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,520
Hey you!

27
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,700
Oi! Wait!!

28
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,470
You pervert!

29
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:25,990
Calm down.

30
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,250
Help me, dad! Help!!

31
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,500
He’s not a thief

32
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,620
Who is he then?

33
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,780
That’s Phupha.

34
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,730
What?

35
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,070
That rich kid?

36
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,800
Yes.

37
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,800
We just don't want to be too close to anyone.

38
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,120
My experiences taught me to keep distance from people.

39
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,850
To avoid getting hurt or stabbed in the back.

40
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,330
That’s how I grew up.

41
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,740
Why are you holding me?

42
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,340
My dad taught me to comfort those in need.

43
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,540
Everything you’ve been through must have been hurtful.

44
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,550
But it’s ok. You can just be yourself here.

45
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,180
Phupha!!

46
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,890
Phupha.

47
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,960
Phupha.

48
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,610
Phupha.

49
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,470
Phupha.

50
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,810
Answer me.

51
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,470
Help!!! Phupha.

52
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,980
Phupha. You stay strong! I’m sorry. I’m really sorry

53
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,290
After Phupha died, I crossed over to this world.

54
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,190
I know it’s hard to believe. But if….

55
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,470
I do.

56
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,090
Ever since we met,

57
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,950
I always dream of you.

58
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:54,210
So that means..Phupha’s memories from the other world are starting to come through?

59
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
I’m not sure either.

60
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,810
Thank you.

61
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,860
Thank you for crossing over to this world to save me.

62
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,900
Hmm.

63
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,590
Kram,

64
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,710
why don’t you go inside?

65
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,860
I’m just…thinking of something.

66
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,740
Can I take you somewhere first?

67
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,820
Hey Jao!!

68
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,290
What the hell are you doing here?

69
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,530
Jao!

70
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,530
Jao!!

71
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,660
#($&)@#

72
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,430
What the hell are you saying?

73
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,260
I said Tai just proposed to Kram.

74
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,630
That’s great news! So you can get over him.

75
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,680
No. I don’t want to.

76
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,640
I don’t want to get over him.

77
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,620
Stop it! Now get up!

78
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,630
Don’t do this!

79
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,460
Let me go. I can use this hand.

80
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,470
Suit yourself.

81
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,290
I’m going now.

82
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,150
Whining Jao.

83
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,540
What did you just say?

84
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,970
Whining Jao.

85
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,040
Whining Jao. How’s that?

86
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,800
You bragger. Now come back! Fuck you.

87
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,060
Why did you bring me up here?

88
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,290
Can you paint for me?

89
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,540
You used to paint for Phupha, right?

90
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,860
Now I want you to paint for me too.

91
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,360
I can.

92
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,730
But

93
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,930
the one I did for Phupha…

94
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,760
was a nude portrait

95
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,520
Sure.

96
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,950
As long as it’s you

97
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,400
who paint it.

98
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,960
What’s wrong? Why are you blushing?

99
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,070
No.

100
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,100
Well, it’s a little hot.

101
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,680
Let me see.

102
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,070
Just a bit warm.

103
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,470
You said it was hot.

104
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,500
Your shoulders are a little uneven.

105
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,630
They look fine.

106
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,060
I don't see anything strange.

107
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,700
And your chest too.

108
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,980
Maybe you’re too far away.

109
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,380
So I couldn't see clearly.

110
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,730
How about this?

111
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,620
Close enough?

112
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,600
Feel me.

113
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,610
Feel my heart.

114
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,640
Feel my body

115
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,930
and slowly let it out.

116
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,820
Tai.

117
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,900
Did I wake you up?

118
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,850
NO.

119
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,350
How long did I sleep for?

120
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,010
Not very long after we…..

121
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,630
I want this moment to last forever.

122
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,730
Me too.

123
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,370
Anything wrong?

124
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,380
Nothing.

125
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,270
Kram!!

126
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,880
Kram…Kram!!

127
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,530
Kram.

128
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,850
Kram.

129
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,020
Kram.

130
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,280
How is he?

131
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,220
He has “Lumana”.

132
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,630
It’s a type of virus that eats up and destroys his internal organs

133
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,980
He will become weakened by days

134
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,610
with illusions with severe headache.

135
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:59,540
In the end he might pass out and not wake up again.

136
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,510
Can it be cured?

137
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:09,880
Bad news is there’s no medicine that cures this 100%

138
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,590
You can only just keep him well maintained.

139
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,190
I have to excuse myself now.

140
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,780
Easy, Kram

141
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,530
Don’t worry.

142
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,380
We’ll find a way to help.

143
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,770
I’ve only heard of it.

144
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:56,190
Never thought I would be having it myself.

145
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,160
Am I really going to die?

146
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,550
Don’t give up hope yet.

147
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,340
He said there might be ways out.

148
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:16,150
Anyone knows there’s a slim chance of surviving it.

149
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,260
I don’t think I’ll make it.

150
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,580
Why does it have to be me!!

151
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,180
It’s alright, Kram.

152
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,300
I miss my dad.

153
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,190
I want to see

154
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,520
give him my one last hug.

155
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,030
I would go all the way

156
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,020
with you to the other side.

157
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,620
You might be risking your life.

158
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,040
Why’s that?

159
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:09,310
Once you cross the boundary,

160
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,780
you’ll hear a squeaky sound that tortures.

161
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,960
Suffering with no solution.

162
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,250
You to death.

163
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,260
How do you know that?

164
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:31,180
Because I met myself who came from the other side 10 years ago.

165
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,600
Phupha.

166
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,250
Did you have a bad dream?

167
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,050
Not really.

168
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,590
Just go back to sleep. We have to be up early.

169
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,520
I have to get a few things done at Big Slum.

170
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,820
You sure you’re going to be ok by yourself?

171
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,650
Of course I can.

172
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,510
You go ahead. Don’t worry about me.

173
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,620
I’ll be back as soon as I can.

174
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,330
Oh you forgot….

175
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,040
I just dropped by to say hi.

176
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,920
And I bought Kram’s favorite fish porridge.

177
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,050
How did you know it’s my favorite?

178
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,260
After you told me about life on the other side,

179
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,650
memories started flowing through

180
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,340
into my head.

181
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,330
This is why I didn’t tell you in the beginning.

182
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,440
I was afraid you may have gotten confused.

183
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,090
But now I feel like I know you better.

184
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,380
And it’s becoming clearer

185
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,260
how the other Phupha feels about Kram.

186
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,200
Sorry if I sound a little strange.

187
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,250
You should go eat something.

188
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,740
I’ll get going now.

189
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,070
Thanks.

190
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,420
Wanna try it today?

191
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,860
Sorry, Run

192
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,660
You don’t appear yourself these days.

193
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,160
Can I be blunt with you?

194
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,070
Is there something on your mind?

195
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,730
Run.

196
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,180
I’ve got a favor to ask.

197
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,870
Are you cold?

198
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
Not really.

199
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,760
You should have something hot to warm you up.

200
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,380
Kram.

201
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,480
Can you come with me, Kram? We’ve gotta talk

202
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,950
Do you like it here?

203
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,320
I’ve been here before.

204
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:11,650
In the other world, I have a dream of setting up a gallery here.

205
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,310
But I haven't done anything yet.

206
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,470
Too bad he was gone too soon.

207
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,530
But you’re still here…

208
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,700
in this world. You can still make it happen.

209
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,520
I can’t pay you, Phupha.

210
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,690
Don’t worry about it.

211
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,680
I have enough to spare.

212
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,410
No. I’m not into freebies.

213
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,730
If there’s anything I can do in return, just let me know.

214
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,440
How about….stay.

215
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:12,580
Stay and have your Lumana cured.

216
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,030
Is this why you brought me here?

217
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,550
Hmm.

218
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,450
I’ve done some thinking.

219
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,370
The only way to have you cured, is I have to help.

220
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,620
I’ll set up a medical institution

221
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,640
and do everything I can to save you

222
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,130
Why?

223
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,290
I want to take care of you for as long as I can.

224
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,070
Would you stay?

225
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,690
What about Run?

226
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:03,100
Run is ok with it.

227
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,500
I know it sounds complicated now.

228
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,270
I have a fiance,

229
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,030
you have Tai.

230
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,060
But at least

231
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,570
let me take care of you as a friend.

232
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,310
I wouldn’t want to run away from the truth now.

233
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:38,400
I’m sorry I couldn’t keep my promise.

234
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,580
to take care of you for the rest of my  life.

235
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,860
Hey!! Enough!

236
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,500
Fuck off!

237
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,160
Where are you going?

238
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,740
That’s my business.

239
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,700
What a loser!

240
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,760
Jao….

241
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,160
Jao.

242
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,160
Don’t kid me.

243
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,410
Fuck!!!

244
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,270
Damn…..just a dream.

245
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,620
What dream? !!

246
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,380
What the fuck are you doing here?

247
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:41,720
You freakin’ loser.

248
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,690
You were drunk by the river!!

249
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,690
Are you mentally retarded?

250
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,050
If I hadn’t found you,

251
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,050
you would have drowned!!

252
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,500
You saved my life?!?

253
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,040
What the hell’s wrong with you? Are things really that bad??

254
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,040
Just leave me alone.

255
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,800
I really want to know.

256
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,800
Why are you so into him?

257
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:18,929
5 years ago

258
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:28,090
Give me the money!

259
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:34,090
Hey!!! Don't you hear?

260
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,610
I said give me the money.

261
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,489
I….I…I don’t have it.

262
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,340
Bullshit!

263
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:43,320
You don't have money, how to eat?

264
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,929
Just give me what you have!.

265
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,100
Oi!

266
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,500
Who kicked my butt?

267
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,880
Tai! Sorry. I’m really sorry.

268
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,370
See what  happens

269
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,370
when you don’t fight back?

270
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,420
I owe him big time.

271
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,540
I fell in love with him right away.

272
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,990
I know I’ll eventually have to let him go….

273
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,830
just not now.

274
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:38,610
You should go shower

275
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,010
before you catch a cold.

276
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,820
What about you?

277
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,180
I’ll get going now.

278
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,230
See you later.

279
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,210
I'm going.

280
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,840
Wayu.

281
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,460
Thank you so much.

282
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,200
Saving my life.

283
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,920
500

284
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,150
Nope. Not paying.

285
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,980
ok. Leaving now.

286
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,130
Safe trip home.

287
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,980
Catch you later.

288
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,530
Jao…..Jao.

289
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,530
Jao…..Jao.

290
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,080
Don’t die on me.

291
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,570
Wake up Jao. Wake up!!

292
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,990
Jao.

293
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,480
Jao. Don’t die on me.

294
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,470
Wake up! Wake up!!

295
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,880
Why did you bring me here?

296
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,810
Phupha wants me to hold an exhibition here.

297
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,110
Wow. What a big favor! He’s very generous, isn’t he?

298
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,110
Phupha knows the whole truth now.

299
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,200
He realizes he’s my lover on the other side.

300
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:09,850
Really?

301
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,680
He wants me to stay.

302
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,000
So he can cure me from Lumana.

303
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,940
So it means….

304
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,090
Kram will move in with you?

305
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,660
I know it sounds complicated now.

306
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,170
But at least

307
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,970
let me take care of you as a friend.

308
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,680
I wouldn’t want to run away from the truth now.

309
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,120
Thanks.

310
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:51,170
But I’ve made up my mind….to be with Tai.

311
00:38:54,630 --> 00:39:00,300
I get it. No matter what, You have my full support.

312
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:04,340
Just let me know what you need.

313
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,660
I wanna get hold of one portrait.

314
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,300
What’s this?

315
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,630
Just open it.

316
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,610
You haven’t finished it, have you?

317
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,590
I can remember how you look.

318
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,630
If it’s not for that night,

319
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:00,000
I wouldn’t have been able to do it.

320
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,000
Really?

321
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:10,850
I’ve been thinking about it for quite some time.

322
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:21,480
And there’s one thing I would regret if I don’t get to do it.

323
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,930
Which is?

324
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,740
Here’s the answer.

325
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,460
Seriously, Kram?

326
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:56,000
Let’s do the Ash Exchange ceremony.

327
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,290
I knew this day would come.

328
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,500
I knew it from the beginning you two are in love.

329
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,530
The way you look at each other.

330
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,060
It's done.

331
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,480
Thanks, Dueandao.

332
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,480
It’s your day.

333
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,560
Hmm.

334
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,420
Kram.

335
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:07,980
Jao.

336
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,110
Good luck, bro.

337
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:09,190
thank you all for your presence here today to witness their love.

338
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:14,750
Ash Exchange is an ancient sacred ceremony.

339
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:21,320
It is believed that if we exchanged ashes from ancestors of the two families,

340
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:27,110
the bonding between the two will be complete.

341
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:33,050
But because you have traveled from afar,

342
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:40,830
you could hold onto the ash of Tai’s grandmother. And Tai will be holding grandfather’s ash.

343
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:49,010
And now is the perfect time. Let us begin.

344
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,180
Kram!

345
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,620
Kram!

346
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,070
Kram.

347
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,060
Kram.

348
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,320
Kram.

349
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:18,300
So they say happy times fly fast

350
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:25,050
It might be too late before we know

351
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:37,740
I missed the chance to tell you how much I love you

352
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:44,580
If I said I love you.

353
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:51,820
If destiny doesn’t part our ways

354
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:58,270
If you’re still here with me

355
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:08,060
I wonder if our hearts want the same thing

356
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:18,050
I don’t want to be in a world without you

357
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:25,090
Only if I could turn back time. Only if I got to see you one more time

358
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:34,060
Don’t want to be in a dream that would never come true

359
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:51,790
Only if I could turn back time. Only if I got to see you one more time

360
00:47:51,820 --> 00:48:02,180
Don’t want to be in a dream that would never come true
